<p>One afternoon during the first weeks of October,
1869, while wind, dust, and rain were struggling each
for supremacy in the streets, a small yellow brougham,
swung in the old-fashioned style on cumbersome
springs and attached to a pair of fine greys, was
standing before the Earl of Garrow's town residence
in St. James's Square. The hall clock within that
mansion chimed four, the great doors were thrown
open by two footmen, and a young lady wearing a
mauve silk skirt deeply flounced, a black cloth jacket
embroidered in gold, and a mauve hat trimmed with
plumes&mdash;appeared upon the threshold. She paused for
a moment to admire the shrubs arranged in boxes on
each window-sill, the crimson vines that brightened
the grey walls; to criticise the fresh brown rosette
under the near horse's ear; to bestow a swift glance
upon the harness, the coachman's livery, and the
groom's boots. Then she stepped into the carriage
and gave her order&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;To the Carlton Club.&#8221;</p>

<p>The groom climbed on to his seat, and the horses,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>after a brilliant display of their well-disciplined mettle,
suffered themselves to be driven, at an easy pace,
toward Pall Mall.</p>

<p>Lady Sara-Louise-Tatiana-Valérie De Treverell,
only child of the ninth Earl of Garrow, had been,
since her mother's death, the mistress of his house and
his chief companion. Essentially a woman of emotions,
she was, nevertheless, in appearance somewhat dreamy,
romantic, even spiritual. The eyes were blue, bright
as a cut sapphire, and shone, as it were, through tears.
Her mouth, uneven in its line, had a scarlet eloquence
more pleasing than sculpturesque severity. At the
moment, she wore no gloves, and her tapering fingers
shared their characteristic with her nose, which also
tapered, with exquisite lightness of mould, into a
point. For colour, she had a gypsy's red and brown.
The string of gold beads which she fastened habitually
round her throat showed well against the warm tints
in her cheek; her long pearl earrings caught in
certain lights the dark shadow of her hair&mdash;hair black,
abundant, and elaborately dressed in the fashion of that
time. Passionate yet calculating, imperious yet susceptible
of control, generous yet given to suspicion, an
egoist yet capable of self-abandoning enthusiasm&mdash;she
represented a type of feminine character often recognised
but rarely understood.</p>

<p>On this particular afternoon in October she had
some pressing matters on her mind. She was considering,
among other things, an offer of marriage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>which she had received by post two days before from
a nobleman of great fortune, the Duke of Marshire.
But Sara was ambitious&mdash;not mercenary. She wanted
power. Power, unhappily, was the last thing one
could associate with the estimable personality of the
suitor under deliberation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must tell papa,&#8221; she said to herself, &#8220;that it
would never do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Here she fell into a reverie; but as her expression
changed from one of annoyance to something of wistfulness
and sentimentality, the question of marriage
with the Duke of Marshire had clearly been dismissed
for that moment from her heart. At intervals a shy
smile gave an almost childish tenderness to her face.
Then, on a sudden, her eyelashes would droop, she
would start with a sigh, and, apparently caught by
some unwelcome remembrance, sink into a humour as
melancholy as it was mysterious. Quiet she sat,
absorbed in her own emotions, heedless alike of the
streets through which she was passing and the many
acquaintances who bowed as she drove by. It was
her daily custom, when in town, to call at the Carlton
Club for her father and take him for a short drive
round the Park before his tea. To-day he was already
waiting on the club steps as the brougham halted
before the entrance. He smiled, joined Lady Sara at
once, and seating himself by her side in his usual
corner, maintained his usual imperturbable reserve.
As a rule, during these excursions he would either
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>doze, or jot down ideas in his note-book, or hum one
of the few songs he cared to hear: &#8220;Go tell Augusta,
gentle swain,&#8221; &#8220;Revenge, revenge, Timotheus cries,&#8221;
and &#8220;She wore a wreath of roses.&#8221; This time, however,
he did neither of these things, but watched the
reflection of his daughter's face in the carriage window
before him. He had white hair, a dyed moustache
and a small imperial&mdash;also dyed the deepest black&mdash;just
under the lower lip. In appearance he was, spite
of the false touches, good-looking, sensitive, and perhaps
too mild. The cleft in his rounded chin was the
sole mark of decision in a countenance whose features
were curved&mdash;wherever a curve was possible&mdash;to a
degree approaching caricature. Temples, eyebrows,
nostrils, and moustache, all described a series of semi-circles
which, accentuated by a livid complexion and
curling hair, presented an effect somewhat commonplace
and a little tiresome. He had spent his existence
among beings to whom nothing seemed natural which
did not depart most earnestly from all that nature is
and teaches: he had always endeavoured to maintain
the ideal of a Christian gentleman where, as a matter
of fact, Christianity was understood rather as a good
manner than a faith, and ideals were prejudices of race
rather than aspirations of the soul. Well-born, well-bred,
and moderately learned, he was not, and could
never be, more than dull or less than dignified. The
second son of his father, he had spent the customary
years of idleness at Eton and Oxford, he had journeyed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>through France, Italy, and Spain, contested unsuccessfully
a seat in Mertford, and thought of reading for the
Bar. But at four-and-thirty he became, through the
influence of his mother's family, groom-in-waiting
to the Queen&mdash;a post which he held till his elder
brother's death, which occurred six months later. At
this point his Court career ceased. A weak heart and
a constitutional dislike of responsibility assisted him in
his firm decision to lead the life of a country nobleman.
He retired to his estate, and remained there in
solitude, troubling no one except his agent, till a
Russian lady, whom he had first met and loved during
his early travels on the Continent, happened to come
visiting in the neighbourhood. As the daughter of a
Russian Prince and Ambassador, she had considered
her rank superior to Lord Garrow's, and therefore felt
justified, as she informed her relations after he had
succeeded to the earldom, in making the first advance
toward their common happiness. The marriage was
soon arranged; the alliance proved successful if not
always serene; one child&mdash;Sara-Louise-Tatiana-Valérie&mdash;was
born, an event which was followed, nine
days later, by the death of the Countess.</p>

<p>Lord Garrow, a man of refined ideas rather than
profound feelings, displayed in mourning his wife's
loss the same gentle, dispassionate, and courteous
persistency with which he had remained constant
to his first impression of her charms. She had been
a beautiful, high-hearted girl; she became a fascinating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>but wayward woman; she died a creature of such
mingled ferocity and sentiment that, had she not
perished when she did, she must have existed in
misery under the storms of her own temperament.
As Garrow watched his daughter's face, he may have
been touched to a deeper chord than usual at the
sight of her strange and growing resemblance to his
dead Tatiana. Did she too possess&mdash;as her mother
had possessed&mdash;the sweet but calamitous gift of loving?
He himself had not been the object of his wife's
supreme devotion. Before the child's birth she had
given him an emerald ring which, she declared, was
all that she valued on earth. It was no gift of his;
it had belonged to a young attaché to her father's
embassy. Affection had taught Lord Garrow something;
he asked no questions; the jewel was placed,
by his orders, on her dead hand; it was buried with
her, and with that burial he included any jealousy
of her early romance. He had been sincerely, wholly
attached to her; he had been proud of her graces and
accomplishments; he knew her virtue and honoured
her pure mind; she was the one woman he had ever
wished to marry. He did not regret, nay, it was
impossible to regret, their marriage. But she had
been ever an alien and a stranger. Each had too
often considered the other's heart with surprise.
True love must rest on a perfect understanding;
at the first lifting of the eyes in wonder there is a
jar which by and by must make the whole emotion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>restless. An unconquerable curiosity lay at the very
root of their lives. She thought him English and
self-sufficient; he thought her foreign and a little
superstitious. This ineffable criticism was constant,
fretful, and ever nearing the climax of uttered reproach.
Sara had inherited all the amazement, but she owned,
as well, its comprehension. She adored passionately
the mother she had never seen; she loved her father,
whom she knew by heart. After exchanging an
affectionate glance with his lordship, she began to
draw on her gloves. Whilst buttoning one she said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you seen him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he replied; &#8220;but, in any case, I think he
would have avoided me to-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From motives of delicacy. Henry Marshire is a
man of the nicest feeling. He is never guilty of the
least mistake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sara smiled, and so disguised a blush.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not mean Marshire,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I was
thinking then of Robert Orange.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert Orange,&#8221; exclaimed Lord Garrow in
astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dear papa. Is he not sometimes at the
Carlton with Lord Wight? He seems to me a
coming man; and so good-looking. We must really
ask him to dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>Some minutes elapsed before the Earl could utter
any comment on a suggestion so surprising, and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>that particular moment so inconsequent. Was his
daughter not weighing&mdash;with prayer, he hoped, and
certainly with all her senses&mdash;the prospect of an
alliance with the Duke of Marshire? How, then,
could she pause in a meditation of such vital interest
to make capricious remarks about a mere acquaintance?</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Marshire know him?&#8221; he asked at last.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope so. He is a remarkable person. But the
party is blind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, the English are an aristocratic people.
They do not forgive mysterious blood and ungentle
origins. While we have our Howards, our Talbots,
and our Poulets&mdash;to say nothing of the De Courcys
and Cliftons&mdash;it would surely seem excessively absurd
to endure the intrusion of French <i>émigrés</i> into our
midst.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How I hate the great world!&#8221; exclaimed Sara,
with vehemence; &#8220;how I dislike the class which
ambition, wealth, and pride separate from the rest of
humanity! My only happiness now is found in
solitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your mother, dear Sara, had&mdash;or fancied so&mdash;this
same desire to shun companionship and be alone.
Her delicate health after our marriage made her fear
society.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are days when it seems an arena of wild
beasts!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nevertheless, my darling, at your age you must
learn to live among your fellow creatures.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I live where I should be afraid to die?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ought you to give way to these moods? Is it
not mistaking the imagination for the soul? Young
people do this, and you are very young&mdash;but two-and-twenty.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am double-hearted,&#8221; said Sara; &#8220;and when one
is double-hearted the tongue must utter contradictions.
I like my advantages while I despise them. I
wish to be thought exclusive, yet I condemn the
pettiness of my ambition. And so on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear,&#8221; said Lord Garrow gravely, &#8220;that your
mind is disturbed by a question which you must soon&mdash;very
soon, my dearest child&mdash;answer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Papa, I cannot.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Surely you will gratify me so far as to take time
before you object to what might possibly be most
desirable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be desirable enough, but is it right?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Right,&#8221; repeated her father, with exasperation.
&#8220;How could it be otherwise than right to marry a
man of Marshire's position, means, stamp, and general
fitness? You would be in possession of a station
where your interest would be as independent as your
spirit. Nothing could have been more brilliant, or
flattering, or more cordial than his offer. I argue
against my natural selfishness for your welfare. I
don't wish to part with you, but I must consider your
future.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke with energy, and Sara knew, from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>length and substance of the speech, that the subject
had been for some time very near his heart. She
resolved, on the instant, not to fail him; but as she
foresaw his crowning satisfaction, she permitted
herself the luxury of prolonging his suspense.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not love him,&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;In marriage one does not require an unconquerable
love but an invincible sympathy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An invincible sympathy!&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;I
have had that for certain friends&mdash;for one or two, at
any rate. For Robert Orange, as an example.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That man again? Why do you dwell upon him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is interesting, he has force, and, as for origin,
do people ever repeat pleasant facts about a neighbour's
pedigree? I believe that his family is every
bit as good as ours. His second name is de Hausée.
No one can pretend that we are even so good as
a genuine de Hausée. We may make ourselves
ridiculous!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me entreat you to guard against these
inequalities in your character. To-day I could even
accuse you of levity. Dearest Sara, Marshire is hardly
the man to be kept waiting for his reply.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not well,&#8221; said Sara, almost in tears.
&#8220;There are hours when I would not give my especial
blessings for any other earthly happiness, and then, a
moment after, the things which pleased me most
become vexations, all but intolerable!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How little importance, then, should we attach to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>our caprices, when we know, by experience, how
short is the pleasure and displeasure they can give,&#8221;
was the careful reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;Caprices!&#8221; said Sara, &#8220;yes, you are right. My
mind gets weary, disgusted, and dismayed. But the
soul is never bored&mdash;never tired. Poor prisoner! It
has so few opportunities.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sighed deeply, and her father saw, with distress,
the approach of a sentimental mood which he deplored
as un-English, and feared as unmanageable.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this languor, this inability to rouse myself,
to feel the least interest in things or people?&#8221; she
continued. &#8220;I am not ill, and yet I have scarcely the
strength to regret my lassitude.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does it mean?&#8221;</p>

<p>He put his hand upon her jacket sleeve.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is this warm enough?&#8221; he said. &#8220;The autumn is
treacherous. You are careful, I hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>She glanced out of the window and up at the clouds
which, grey, heavy, and impenetrable, moved, darkening
all things as they went across the sky.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish it would rain! I like to be out when it
rains!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A strange fancy,&#8221; said her father, &#8220;but tastes,
even odd ones, give a charm to life, whereas passions&mdash;&#8220;
he put some stress upon the word and repeated it,
&#8220;passions destroy it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marshire, at any rate, does not seem to possess
either!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, a man must begin at some point, and, at
some point, he must change. He admires and respects
you, my darling, so we may hardly quarrel with his
judgment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sara shrugged her shoulders and turned her glance
away from the few carriages filled with invalids or
elderly women which were still lingering in the
Row.</p>

<p>&#8220;Some people,&#8221; said she, &#8220;are driven by their
passions, others, the smaller number, by their virtues.
Marshire has asked me to marry him because it is his
duty to choose a wife from his own circle. I have no
illusions in the matter. Nor, I fancy, has he. We
have talked, of course, of love and Platonism till both
love and Platonism became a weariness!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very far indeed am I from thinking you just. I
have had an extremely kind note from the Duchess.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An old tyrant! She wants a daughter-in-law
who will play piquet with her in the evenings, and
feed her peacocks in the morning. She is tired of
poor Miss Wilmington. An old tyrant!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She hopes to hear soon when the marriage is to
take place. I wish I could tell her the day. I do so
long to have it fixed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear papa,&#8221; she said, with a charming smile,
&#8220;you are anxious, I see, to be rid of me. I will
write to him to-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And to what effect?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The wisest.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That means the happiest, too?&#8221; he asked with
anxiety.</p>

<p>&#8220;For you and him, I hope. As for me&mdash;am I a
woman who could, by any chance, be both happy
and wise at the same moment?&#8221;</p>

<p>Her existence was very solitary. The flippancy of
the lives around her, the inanity of her relatives' pursuits,
their heedlessness of those inner qualities which
make the real&mdash;indeed, the only considerable difference
between man and man, could but fret, and mortify,
and abash a heart which, in the absence of any religious
faith, had, at any rate, the need of it. Her father,
who entertained clear views of &#8220;the right thing&#8221; and
&#8220;the wrong thing&#8221; in social ethics, was still too rigid
a formalist in the exposition of his theories to reach an
intelligence with whom the desire of virtues would
have to come as a passion&mdash;inspiring and inspired or
else be utterly repudiated. Utilitarianism, and the
greatest happiness of the greatest number, comfortable
domestic axioms, little schemes for the elevation of the
masses by the classes, had, on their logical basis, no
attraction for this sceptical, wayward girl. To be
merely useful was, in her eyes, to make oneself meddlesome
and absurd. The object of existence was to be
heroic or nothing. She could imagine herself a Poor
Clare: she could not imagine herself as a great young
lady dividing her hours judiciously between district
visiting and the ball-room, between the conquest of
eligible bachelors and the salvation of vulgar souls.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>Marshire, she knew, had sisters and cousins who did
these things and were considered patterns. No wonder
then that she turned pale and became fretful at the
prospect of her views clashing inevitably with his.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot be wise and happy at the same moment,&#8221;
she repeated.</p>

<p>At that instant the carriage, which was then rolling
toward Hyde Park Corner, came to an abrupt standstill,
and, on looking out, Lord Garrow observed that
the coachman had halted in obedience to a signal from
a gentleman who was galloping, at a hard pace, after
their brougham.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be Reckage,&#8221; said the Earl; &#8220;I never knew
a man so fond of riding who rode so ill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What, I wonder, does he want now?&#8221; said Sara,
flushing a little. &#8220;I didn't know that he was in town.&#8221;</p>

<p>By that time the pursuer, a handsome man with an
auburn beard and very fine blue eyes, had reached
them.</p>

<p>&#8220;This,&#8221; he shouted, &#8220;is a rushing beast of a horse;&#8221;
but, before he could explain his errand, the hunter,
who was nearly quite thoroughbred and a magnificent
animal, dashed on, evidently determined to gain, without
delay, some favourite destination.</p>

<p>&#8220;Extraordinary!&#8221; said Lord Garrow. &#8220;Extraordinary!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But so like him,&#8221; observed his daughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he has made us late for tea. What a stupid
fellow!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>It was exactly five minutes past five when they
reached St. James's Square. The sun, a globe, set in
thin lines of yellow light, shone out above the trees,
which were dull but not yet leafless. Grey and sulphurous
and gold-edged clouds floated in masses on the
blue sky. It had been a day of changes&mdash;yet it
seemed to Sara, whose own moods had been as various,
the ordinary passing away of time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Upon my word,&#8221; said his lordship, &#8220;it is too bad!
They may say what they please about Reckage, but I
call him a spooney. That horse was a noble horse&mdash;a
most superior horse. He couldn't manage him. I
wish he would sell him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He would never do anything so much to his own
advantage,&#8221; was the dry response. &#8220;Poor Reckage is a
brilliant fool&mdash;he's selfish, and therefore he miscalculates.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sara was now talking mechanically&mdash;as she often did
when she was with those whom she loved or liked, but
from whom she was separated in every thought,
interest, and emotion. The lassitude of which she had
complained at the beginning of their drive returned
upon her. Sighing heavily, she entered the house and
mounted the long staircase to the drawing-room, where
the tea-table was already spread, the flame quivering
under the kettle, the deep pink china laid out on a
silver tray. But the homeliness of the scene and its
familiarity had no power to soothe that aching, distracted
heart. Had she been a man, she thought, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>might have sought her refuge in ceaseless work, in
great ambitions, in achievements. This eternal tea-pouring
and word-mincing, this business of forced
laughter and garlanded conversation was more than she
could endure. A low cry of impatience, too long and
also too loosely imprisoned, escaped from her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; asked Lord Garrow, who
was following close upon her heels.</p>

<p>&#8220;Life,&#8221; she said, &#8220;life! That is all that ever does
matter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ain't you happy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, but I have it in me to be happy&mdash;an appalling
capability. Let us say no more about it. I must join
myself to eternity, and so find rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said her father, who now felt that he had a
right to complain, &#8220;my poor uncle used to say, if
women deserved happiness they would bear it better.
Few of them bear it well&mdash;and this is a fact I have
often brought before me.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II"></a>CHAPTER II</h2>


<p>When Sara had prepared Lord Garrow's tea and cut
the leaves of the <i>Revue des Deux Mondes</i>, which he
invariably read until he dressed for dinner, she stole
away to the further room, where she could play the
piano, write letters, muse over novels, or indulge in
reverie without fear of interruption. But as she
entered it that afternoon its air of peace seemed the
bleakness of desolation. A terrible and afflicting grief
swept, like an icy breeze, through her heart, and,
whether from actual physical pain or the excitement of
the last few hours, tears started to her eyes, her cheeks
flushed, and she fell to passionate weeping. The smiling
Nymphs painted on the ceiling above her head and
the rose leaves they were for ever scattering to the
dancing Hours (a charming group, and considered very
cheerful), could not relieve her woe. She cried long
and bitterly, and was on the verge of hysterics when
the door opened and her most intimate woman friend,
the Viscountess Fitz Rewes, was announced. This
bewitching creature&mdash;who was a widow, with two long
flaxen curls, a sweet figure, and the smile of an angel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>&mdash;embraced
her dear, dear Sara with genuine affection,
and pretended not to see her swollen eyelids. Sara
possessed for Pensée Fitz Rewes the fascination of a
desperate nature for a meek one. The audacity,
brilliancy, and recklessness of the younger woman
at once stimulated and established the other's gentle
piety.</p>

<p>They talked for fifteen minutes about the autumn
visits they had paid, the visits they would have to pay,
and the visits which nothing in the world would induce
them to pay.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been at home, at Catesby, most of the
time,&#8221; said Pensée; &#8220;a very quiet, happyish time, on
the whole. I had a few people down, but I saw a
great deal of a particularly nice person. She is a
foreigner&mdash;an archduchess really. Her father made a
morganatic marriage. I am so glad they don't have
morganatic marriages in England. I don't like to be
uncharitable, but they seem, in a way, so improper.
Madame de Parflete is all one could wish. Her husband
was a dreadful man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did he do?&#8221; said Sara, who was a little
absent.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, all kinds of things. He committed suicide in
the end. And now&mdash;she is going to marry a friend of
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never told you about him before,&#8221; said Pensée,
&#8220;but I am so miserable to-day that you may as well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>know. He was a sort of brother, yet much more.
One didn't meet him often in our set, because he
didn't and doesn't care about it. Life, however, threw
us together.&#8221;</p>

<p>She covered her wan face with her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;How am I to give him up?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;How
shall I bear it? I get so unhappy. I asked my little
boy the other day what he did when I went away
from home. He said&mdash;&#8216;I gather chestnuts and feel
lonely.&#8217; And I asked my little girl what she did, and
she said&mdash;&#8216;I cry till you come back again.&#8217; There's
the difference between men and women. I am like
my poor Lilian. You, Sara, if you could be wretched,
would be more like the boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think so?&#8221; said Sara.</p>

<p>&#8220;That wonderful passage in the New Testament&mdash;I
often remember it! After all the agony and
separation were over, Simon Peter said to the disciples,
<i>I go a fishing</i>. He went back to the work he was
doing when our Lord first called him. What
courage!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go on,&#8221; said Sara, &#8220;go on!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, my heart has been taking an undue
complacency in the creature, and this seldom fails to
injure. I have a wish to be free from distress, and
enjoy life. As if we were born to be happy! No,
this world is a school to discipline souls and fit them
for the other. I must forget my friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nonsense!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be very hard. I took such an interest in
his career. If I didn't mention him to you, or to other
people, I mentioned him often to God. And now&mdash;it
is somewhat awkward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You little goose,&#8221; said Sara, &#8220;you have a heart of
crystal. Nothing could be awkward for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My heart,&#8221; said Pensée, with a touch of resentment,
&#8220;is just as dangerous and wicked as any other
heart! You misunderstand me wilfully. I like prayer
at all times, because it is a help and because it lifts one
out of the world. Oh, when shall every thought be
brought into captivity?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen!&#8221; said Sara, &#8220;listen! If there is an
attractiveness in human beings so lovely that it could
call your Almighty God Himself from heaven to
dwell among them and to die most cruelly for their
sakes, is it to be expected that they will not&mdash;and who
will dare say that they should not?&mdash;as mortals themselves,
discover qualities in each other which draw out
the deepest affection? I have no patience with your
religion&mdash;none.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are most unkind, and I won't tell you any
more,&#8221; replied Pensée, who looked, however, not ungrateful
for Sara's view of the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me tell you something about me,&#8221; said her
friend fiercely. &#8220;I never say my prayers, because I
cannot say them, but I love somebody, too. Whenever
I hear his name I could faint. When I see him
I could sink into the ground. At the sight of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>handwriting I grow cold from head to foot, I tremble,
my heart aches so that it seems breaking in two. I
long to be with him, yet when I am with him I have
nothing to say. I have to escape and be miserable all
alone. He is my thought all day: the last before I
sleep, the first when I awake. I could cry and cry
and cry. I try to read, and I remember not a word.
I like playing best, for then I can almost imagine
that he is listening. But when I stop playing and
look round, I find myself in an empty room. It is
awful. I call his name; no one answers. I whisper
it; still no answer. I throw myself on the ground,
and I say, &#8216;Think of me! think of me! you shall,
you must, you do think of me!&#8217; It is great
torture and a great despair. Perhaps it is a madness
too. But it is my way of loving. I want to live
while I live. If I knew for certain that he loved me&mdash;me
only&mdash;the joy, I think, would kill me. Love!
Do you know, poor little angel, what it means?
Sometimes it is a curse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pensée, before this torrent, was shaking like some
small flower in a violent gale.</p>

<p>&#8220;You say things, Sara, that no one says&mdash;things
that one ought not to say. You must be quieter.
You won't be happy when you are married if you
begin with so much feeling!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not going to marry that one,&#8221; said Sara
bitterly. &#8220;I am going to marry Marshire.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Fitz Rewes had too delicate a face to contain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>any expression of the alarm and horror she felt at this
statement. She frowned, bit her lips, and sank back
in her chair. What stroke of fate, she wondered, had
overtaken the poor girl? Was she sane? Was she
herself? Pensée found some relief in the thought
that Sara was not herself&mdash;a state into which most
people are presumed to fall whenever, from stress or
emotion, they become either strictly candid or perfectly
natural.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a fancy. Fancies are in my blood,&#8221; said
Sara; &#8220;you need not be anxious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But&mdash;but what feeling have you for Marshire?&#8221;
murmured Pensée.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have a faint inclination not to dislike him
utterly. And I will be a good wife to him. If I
say so, I shall keep my word. You may be sure of
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could never doubt your honour, Sara. Is the
other man quite, quite out of the question?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But perhaps he does love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, he doesn't. He may think me picturesque
and rather entertaining. It never went deeper than
that. I saw at once that his mind was fixed on some
other woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose one can always tell when a man's
affections are really engaged,&#8221; said Pensée, with a
sigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, beyond any doubt. You feel that they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>comparing you at every point, in a silent, cold-blooded
way, to the bright particular star. I envy you,
Pensée; you, at least, were desperately loved by
Lionel. But I&mdash;never, never was loved&mdash;except
once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who was he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He was a Russian, very good-looking, and a
genius. But oh, I wasn't old enough to understand
him. When he died, I cried for half a day and seven
nights. And after that, not a tear. You see, I didn't
understand myself either.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do I know this other one ... the one, now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I won't tell you his name. Perhaps, another
time, when we are all very old ... and he is dead
... or I am dying....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don't say that!&#8221; exclaimed Pensée, &#8220;don't
say that! You are making a lot of misery for yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not at all. I am making the most of my one
saving grace. There is nothing very nice about me&mdash;except
that. And he is a man. The only real one
among all our friends&mdash;the only one for whom I have
the least respect. If any woman had his love&mdash;how
sure, how happy she could be! I could work, and
starve, and lay down my life for a man like that. If
he had loved me, I think I could have been almost
a good woman, a downright good one, a Saint
Elizabeth of Hungary. But you see that wasn't to
be. And so I am just this&mdash;&mdash;&#8220; She looked in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>glass and pointed a white finger, loaded with rings of
black pearls, at her reflection. &#8220;I am just this&mdash;a
vain, idle fool like all the rest&mdash;except you, poor
darling.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don't you keep up your music?&mdash;your
wonderful playing? Every one says it is so wonderful.
That's a great outlet for emotion. And your
languages&mdash;why not work an hour a day each at
Italian, Spanish, German, and French? That would
kill four hours of the day straight off!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Bah!&#8221; said Sara, &#8220;I cannot play&mdash;unless there is
some one to play for. As for languages&mdash;I cannot
talk alone. And as for reading&mdash;I cannot find all my
world between the covers of a book.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But live for others, dear Sara.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to live for myself. I have one inseparable
companion&mdash;that is myself. I want to suffer my own
sufferings, and enjoy my own enjoyments. This
living for others is absurd. I hate second-hand
emotions; they are stale and dull. But, Pensée,
you haven't told me the name of your friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought I had,&#8221; said Pensée, simply; &#8220;you will
see it in the marriage notice the day after to-morrow.
It is Robert Orange.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sara stared for a moment. Then the string of gold
beads which she wore round her throat suddenly
broke, and the shining ornaments fell all about her
to the floor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me!&#8221; said Sara, kneeling down with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>ghastly laugh. Pensée knelt too, and they gathered
the scattered necklace between them. &#8220;Dear me! I
was never more surprised&mdash;never; and yet I cannot
think why I am surprised. He is very handsome.
Any woman would like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; said Pensée, full of thoughts.</p>

<p>Sara proceeded to count her beads, lest one should
be missing. But they were all there, and she tied
them up in her handkerchief.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pensée,&#8221; she said, presently. &#8220;I will tell his
name after all, because you have been so frank with
me. The one I ... love is Beauclerk Reckage.&#8221;
As she uttered this lie, she cast down her eyes and
blushed to the very heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beauclerk!&#8221; exclaimed Pensée, in amazement.
&#8220;Then there <i>is</i> some hope after all! There is,
there must be! Beauclerk! He is engaged to
Agnes Carillon, of course. But all the same....&#8221;</p>

<p>The conversation flagged. Lord Garrow, who had
heard a distant murmuring but not their words, now,
as their animation failed, came in.</p>

<p>&#8220;My little girl,&#8221; said he, &#8220;has been moping. I am
very glad that you called ... very glad indeed. And
Sara, my darling....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, papa.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you asked Pensée the name of that
extremely pretty song she sang for us when we all
dined together at Lord Wight's? You remember the
evening?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>But Sara, with a wail, fled away. Pensée caught a
glimpse of her white, agonised countenance as she
rushed past them, moaning, to her own room.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is dreadful,&#8221; said Lord Garrow, horribly
annoyed&mdash;&#8220;dreadful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is indeed,&#8221; replied Lady Fitz Rewes gravely.
&#8220;I suppose....&#8221;</p>

<p>She wanted to say that she hoped the Marshire-de
Treverell alliance was still undecided. But something
in his lordship's air&mdash;a hardness she had never thought
to see in his regard&mdash;forbade any reference to the
subject. He conducted her to her carriage, wished
her &#8220;Goodbye&#8221; in his Court manner, and led her to
understand, by an unmistakable glance, that a certain
marriage which had been arranged would, inasmuch
as it was entirely agreeable to the will of Providence,
take place.</p>

<p>Lord Reckage, in the meantime, had not been able
to draw rein until he reached Grafton Street, where
the hunter, of its own will, stopped short at a door,
half glass and half mahogany, before which a groom
stood watching, evidently with some suspense, for
their approach. At the first sight of the animal and
its rider, he hastened forward, and, seizing the bridle,
assisted his master to dismount. Once on the ground,
the young man satisfied his spleen by hitting the horse
several vicious cuts with his whip. Then he informed
the servant that it was his intention to walk home,
and, with an ominous scowl, watched the &#8220;rushing
beast&#8221; led from his sight. No one, except himself,
was permitted to occupy that saddle.</p>

<p>The house which he now entered had been the
town mansion for three generations of the Hampshires,
but, despised by its then owner, whose young duchess
wanted an Italian villa on Piccadilly, or a French
château in Park Lane, the lease had been sold to a
syndicate of rising politicians who formed a small
organisation known, in those days, as the Mirafloreans.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;The little order,&#8221; we read in the Hon. Hercy
Berenville's Memoirs, a malicious work printed for
private circulation only&mdash;&#8220;the little order first came
into notice under the name of the &#8216;Bond of Association,&#8217;
a High Church society founded by my brother,
Lord Reckage. He formed his executive committee,
however, on timorous and unexpected lines. He had
tried to please the spiteful rather than the loyal. The
loyal, he urged, were always forbearing, but the spiteful
needed every attention. He disappointed alike the
warmest and the most selfish among his supporters.
True to his policy, he made desperate attempts to win
over some vindictive men from among the Radicals,
and, finally, in a fit of nervousness, declared, after five
months of fruitful folly, his determination to reorganise
the whole league on a strictly non-sectarian
basis. He described himself as a moral philosopher.
Once more he became a figure of interest, again he
raised the standard, again he attracted a small company
of enthusiasts, again it was expected that God's
enemies would be scattered. He invited his former
secretary, a Roman Catholic, to join the new society,
but he made it clear that Orange, a man of real
distinction, was in no sense a prominent member.
The precise dogmata of Mirafloreanism&mdash;a nickname
given, I believe, in ironic sympathy by Mr. Disraeli&mdash;were
undefined, but the term gradually became
associated with those ideals of conduct, government,
and Art which poets imagine, heroes realise, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>ignorant destroy. Men of all, sundry, and opposing
beliefs presumed to its credentials. Some, because
the club appeared to flourish, many because it was
not yet overcrowded, and a few because they were in
perfect agreement with the varying opinions of its
ultimate presiding genius, Disraeli himself. They
worked quietly, not in the House of Commons, but
outside it, delivering lectures, writing books, starting
newspapers, holding meetings, and enlisting the
sympathies of rich, idle, ambitious, or titled women.
There seemed no end or limit to the variety of their
interests, their methods of labour, or their conceit.
The club&mdash;judged by the leonine measure of success&mdash;as
a club did little for learning or literary men. It
became a mere meeting-house for dining and drinking,
but it promoted cordiality among the leading members
of the young Tory party, and brought persons together
who could not, in the ordinary way of life, have met
each other at all. Although the more gaudy and best
known among them came from the first second-rate
families in England, the rank and file were formed
mainly by young men of good estate and breeding&mdash;the
sons of clergy, country squires, or merchants, all
sprung from that class which is called Middle, because
it represents civilised society neither in its rough
beginnings nor in its tawdry decay.&#8221;</p>

<p>Berenville's remarks, it will be plainly seen, anticipate
our history a little, for, at the time of which
we write, the Bond of Association was still maintain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>ing
a sickly existence on its original programme.
Orange had not yet been invited to join it, nor
had Lord Reckage declared himself a moral
philosopher.</p>

<p>On this particular afternoon his lordship entered,
from the street, a narrow vestibule, the red walls of
which were lit up by wax candles set at either end in
ponderous bronze chandeliers. From this he passed
into a square inner hall, paved with marble, and
furnished by carved seats which had once belonged
to the choir of an ancient chapel in Northumberland.
Here he paused, for his attention was immediately
arrested by a small group of four or five individuals
who were talking with great earnestness at the foot
of the oak staircase. Not that this was, in itself, an
unusual event, for ever since a memorable day when
the Earl of Bampton and the young Archdeacon of
Soham, feeling warm, had ordered their tea to be
served in that part of the building, it had been the
fashion for distinguished members to assemble there,
dispersing themselves in careless profusion among the
statues of departed ecclesiastics or reclining pleasantly
on the blue velvet divan which occupied the centre
of the floor.</p>

<p>Foremost in the little company on this occasion
stood Sir Edward Ullweather and Nigel Bradwyn,
both private secretaries, and each secretly convinced
that his peculiar powers would have found brilliant,
volcanic opportunities of demonstration in the other's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>more promising berth. Ullweather, whose life had
been devoted to the study of agricultural problems,
was subordinate to the Secretary of State for War.
Bradwyn, on the other hand, who had planted his
soul in the East, was now learning what he could, at
the nation's expense, of the nation's domestic policy.
Demoralised by disappointment, and made cynical by
toiling over interests for which they had, at best, but
a forced regard, little remained in their breasts but a
sore determination to make the best of an abiding
discontent. In joining Lord Reckage's Committee,
they found themselves again, as they believed, in a
false position. The second-rate mind, whether represented
in a person or by a council, shrinks from the
adoption of simple measures, and invariably seeks to
make itself conspicuous by so placing others as to
make them appear unnecessary. The special genius
of Lord Reckage was shown, perhaps, in his abilities
in this direction, and, while he missed no opportunity
of engaging men of proved capabilities for his service,
his jealousy drove him so to employ them that they
were never permitted to do their best either for him
or for themselves. This policy carried in itself the
sting for its own destruction.</p>

<p>Not far from Ullweather and Bradwyn, Randall
Hatchett, the youngest member of the Executive,
lounged against a pillar. Proud of a distinction which
he dared not comprehend (for a commercial shrewdness
made him suspect that he owed his position less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>to merit than to the subtle promises conveyed by a
weak chin), this distinguished person tried to look the
secrets which his colleagues had never permitted him
to learn. In moody weariness he would sometimes
condescend to the company of his subordinates on the
General Committee and, while listening to their
irresponsible prattle, he would seem to forget the
onerous public interests the absolute neglect of which
was his chief duty at the Council board.</p>

<p>Near this gentleman were two others, Hartley
Penborough, the editor of <i>The Sentinel</i>, and the Hon.
Charles Aumerle, whose guest he was.</p>

<p>As Lord Reckage entered and showed some intention
of joining in the conversation, they appeared by a
silent and common consent to ignore his approach.
He turned to the hall porter, gave him some instructions
in a low voice and passed on, livid with annoyance,
to the library beyond.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hullo!&#8221; exclaimed Aumerle, &#8220;that was Reckage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; said Randall Hatchett.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why didn't you speak to him?&#8221; asked Aumerle.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because,&#8221; said Bradwyn, &#8220;our good Hatchett is
not so sure of himself that he can afford to be civil
even to a President out of fashion!&#8221;</p>

<p>No one smiled except Hatchett himself, because
each one felt it was unwise to encourage Bradwyn's
peculiar humour.</p>

<p>&#8220;I would have spoken to Reckage,&#8221; said Ullweather,
with a superior air, &#8220;but I have never felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>the same toward him since he threw over Orange at
the time of his election.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And several other old friends more recently!&#8221;
observed the injudicious Bradwyn.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't speak of myself,&#8221; said Ullweather, &#8220;but
Orange was unusually devoted to the fellow; and all I
wish to make clear is this, that when Reckage ever
said or did the right thing in times past, the credit was
solely due to Orange. He weeded prophecy from his
speeches, and rudeness from his jokes. Great services,
I assure you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True,&#8221; said Randall Hatchett, &#8220;for there is
nothing more fatal to a political career than brilliant
impromptus and spirited orations. A statesman's
words, like butcher's meat, should be well weighed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have so many prescriptions for success,&#8221; said
Bradwyn, &#8220;that I wonder you ain't President yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckage has taken us all in,&#8221; said Ullweather.</p>

<p>&#8220;By no means,&#8221; said Bradwyn. &#8220;I maintained
from the first that he was overrated. His genial
manner&mdash;his open-hearted smile! Men always smile
at creditors whom they don't intend to pay.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I foretold the whole situation,&#8221; observed Penborough.
&#8220;I said, &#8216;Let Reckage once get full power,
and he will fool us all.&#8217; He affects not to be ambitious,
and to prefer moral science to immoral politics.
I have no faith in these active politicians who make
long speeches to the public, and assure their friends, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>very short notes, that they prefer trout-fishing to the
cares of State! There is but one man who can save
the society now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Bradwyn, Hatchett, and Ullweather looked up,
each armed with a modest and repudiating smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who?&#8221; asked Hatchett, looking down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Robert Orange,&#8221; said Penborough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Probably,&#8221; replied Hatchett, after a minute's
hesitation. &#8220;Probably, Orange ... in time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't you like him?&#8221; said Penborough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like him!&#8221; answered Hatchett, rolling up his
eyes. &#8220;He's an angel!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He calls him an angel as though he wished he
were one in reality,&#8221; said Bradwyn. &#8220;I know these
generous rivals!&#8221;</p>

<p>Ullweather stood gnawing his upper lip.</p>

<p>&#8220;Orange,&#8221; he said, at last. &#8220;Oh, Orange has
arrived. He will get no further. Of course, he won
that election, but Dizzy managed that. Dizzy is the
devil! And then, he is still devoted to Reckage, and,
for a man of his supposed shrewdness, I call that a
sign of evident weakness.&#8221;</p>

<p>At this, Charles Aumerle, who had been listening
with the deepest attention to all that passed, looked
straight at the speaker.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should respect,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that liberty, which
we all have to deceive ourselves. Reckage has many
good points.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Penborough, &#8220;he has no moral force,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>no imagination. He judges men by their manners,
which is silly. He thinks that every one who is polite
to him believes in him. He will have to send in his
resignation before long.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don't mean it,&#8221; said Aumerle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean more,&#8221; continued Penborough. &#8220;He
could not choose a better moment than the present.
In another month, on its present lines, the whole
league will have foundered. Should he remain, he
would have to sink with the ship. Now, however, it
appears safe enough&mdash;people see only what you see&mdash;a
good cargo of influential names on the committee
and a clear horizon. He could plead ill-health, or his
marriage&mdash;in fact, a dozen excellent reasons for
momentary retirement. The world would praise his
tact. As for the rest, those who have been disillusioned
will lose their heads, those who were merely
self-seekers will probably lose their places, but the
trimmers always keep something. The thing, then,
is to cultivate the art of trimming.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you forget that Reckage is going to marry
Miss Carillon,&#8221; said Aumerle. &#8220;Miss Carillon will
always advise the safe course.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's all very well,&#8221; said Bradwyn, &#8220;but there
has been too much arrangement in that marriage! I
can tell you how the engagement came about. She
was intimate with his aunt. He acquired the habit of
her society on all decorous occasions. Still, he never
proposed. The aunt invited her to Almouth. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>stayed two months. Still, not a word. Her papa grew
impatient, ordered her home. The next day she came
to the breakfast-table with red eyes, and announced her
departure. The boxes were packed; she went to take
a last look at the dear garden. Reckage followed, Fate
accompanied him. He spoke. She sent a telegram
to her papa: &#8216;Detained. Important. Will write.&#8217;
No, the real woman for him was Lady Sara de
Treverell.&#8221;</p>

<p>Ullweather thrust his tongue into his cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Sara has been called to higher destinies,&#8221;
said he, &#8220;than the heavenly &#8216;sweet hand in hand!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you know,&#8221; said Bradwyn, with a mysterious
glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Ullweather. &#8220;The friendship of the
Duke of Marshire for Lady Sara increases every day,
and the little fit of giddiness which seized him when
he was dining with my Chief makes me think that
admiration is developing into love. I am in great
hopes that this match may come off.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As to that,&#8221; said Hatchett, &#8220;her father and the
Duke were the night before last at Brooks's, but no
conversation passed between them. This does not
look as though a very near alliance were in contemplation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There are prettier women than she in the world,&#8221;
said Aumerle.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never seen her,&#8221; said Penborough.</p>

<p>&#8220;Large eyes, a small head, and the devil of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>temper,&#8221; said Bradwyn; &#8220;and sympathies&mdash;there never
was a young woman with so many sympathies! There
is an old proverb,&#8221; he added, with a sneer, &#8220;&#8216;They are
not all friends of the bridegroom who seem to be
following the bride.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>Ullweather was still absorbed in his own meditation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marshire,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is the man for us. We might
do something with Marshire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nevertheless,&#8221; said Penborough, &#8220;I have my eye
on Orange.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say,&#8221; exclaimed Bradwyn, &#8220;be careful. Here is
Reckage again. How the dickens did he pass us?&#8221;</p>

<p>The men glanced up at a solitary figure which now
appeared descending the broad staircase. In silence,
and with a studied expression of contempt, without a
look either to the right or to the left, the unpopular
leader passed through the hall and out into the street.</p>

<p>&#8220;A lonely beggar, after all,&#8221; said Bradwyn.</p>

<p>Reckage was dining at home that evening with
Orange, whose marriage was to take place at the
Alberian Embassy on the morrow. The young man
was not in good spirits at his friend's step, for he
himself was about to take a wife also, and much of
the apprehension which he felt on his own account
found its vent in dreary soliloquies on the risk, sacrifices,
responsibilities, and trouble involved by the single
act of saddling oneself for a lifetime with some one
woman. Reckage, for his own part, had loved one
lady very well, yet not so madly that he could resign
himself to loving her only, to the exclusion of all others.
He walked along toward Almouth House in a mood
of many vexations, cursing the impudence of Bradwyn
and Ullweather, wondering whether he had done
wisely, after all, in engaging himself to the blameless
Miss Carillon, sighing a little over a rumour which
had reached him about Sara de Treverell and the
Duke of Marshire, deploring the obstinacy of Robert
Orange where Mrs. Parflete was concerned. He
admitted that Mrs. Parflete was an exceedingly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>beautiful, young, and, as it happened, rich person.
He owned her delightfulness for a man of Robert's
dreamy, romantic, intense temperament. But marriage
between two idealists so highly strung, and so
passionately attached as these two beings were&mdash;what
would happen? No doubt they would be able to
endure the inevitable disillusions&mdash;(inevitable because
Nature is before all things sensual and has no care for
mental prejudices one way or the other)&mdash;the inevitable
disillusions of family life. It was scarcely possible
that the devotion of Robert and Mrs. Parflete would
not waver or seem less exquisite under this discipline.
Their dream of love would become unparadised. It
would gain a sadness, a melancholy, a note of despair
hard to endure and most difficult to repress. Reckage
had no transcendentalism in his own philosophy: he
divided men into two classes&mdash;those who read, and
those who could not stand, Dante. He included
himself among the latter with a frankness at once
astonishing and welcome even to numbers who
thought him, in most matters, a hypocrite. The
hold of the world was growing daily stronger upon
him. His ambitions were already sullied by many
unworthy and deadening ideas. He dwelt a great
deal on the fleetingness of life, and the wisdom of
making the best of its few charming things. Food,
and wine, and money, and fine houses, and amusements
were subjects on which he expended a large
amount of silent enthusiasm. But, for all this, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>could still see much to admire&mdash;perhaps to envy&mdash;in
Robert's more spiritual mind, and he dreaded&mdash;as men
often do dread in such cases&mdash;the effect of a woman's
companionship on so ascetic a character.</p>

<p>&#8220;He knows nothing about women&mdash;nothing,&#8221; he
told himself. &#8220;He has no experience. He takes
them too seriously.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was, while he admitted his own unreasonableness,
a little shocked at the very notion of Orange
with a wife and children. It went against the grain,
and upset the ideals of austerity which he had carefully
planned&mdash;not for himself, but for his friend. Robert,
he urged, was born to be an example&mdash;an encouragement
to those who were called, by the mercy of God,
to less rigorous vocations. Reckage suffered many
scruples of conscience on Robert's account; he surveyed
him with a sense of disappointment; he had
always supposed that he would ultimately turn Jesuit
in sober earnest, and die a martyr's death in the Far
East. This would, in his opinion, have been a fine
end to a Quixotic, very touching, most remarkable
life. Would he now immaturely fall a victim to an
enticing face and the cares of a household? Would
he be able to sustain his character? One thing was
certain. He could never again expect to exercise precisely
the same potent influence as he had in the past,
over his earth-bound, self-indulgent friends. Self-indulgent
people always exacted unusual privations
from those who would seek to move them&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>Robert's call was clearly to materialists rather than
to the righteous. Pusey married, it was true. Keble
married. No one thought the less of them on that
account. Even the judicious Hooker married. And
they were clergymen. Reckage called them priests.
But Newman did not marry, and, while Reckage was
unable to agree in the main with Newman's views, he
had a fixed notion that he was the strong man&mdash;the
master spirit&mdash;among them. And another consideration.
The passion of love has a danger for very sensitive,
reserved, and concentrated minds unknown to
creatures of more volatile, expansive, and unreflecting
disposition. Reckage knew well that he was himself
too selfish a man to let affection for any one creature
come between his soul and its God. There was no
self-discipline required in his case when a choice had
to be made between a human being and his own
advantage&mdash;whether temporal or eternal. He had
never&mdash;since he was a youth&mdash;felt an immoderate
fondness for anybody; he had likes and dislikes,
admirations and partialities, jealousies, too, and well-defined
tastes where feminine beauty was in question,
but it was not in him to err from excess of charity.
The imaginative and visionary parts of life&mdash;and no
one is wholly without them&mdash;soon turned into severe
reality whenever he found himself confronted with
that sole absorbing interest&mdash;his career. Marriage,
in his own case, seemed an imperative duty. He was
an eldest son, the heir to an earldom and a vast estate;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>he wished to lead a distinguished, comfortable, and
edifying existence. His wife would be a helpmate,
not a snare; the mother of his children, not the light
of his eyes. But what a difference in Robert's case&mdash;with
his capacity for worship, for really intense and
absorbing passion. All this was especially transparent
to Reckage, who, as a man of the world, had watched
his friend for months, detecting the shattering physical
effects of an iron restraint imposed on every thought,
mood, and inclination. He had enjoyed the spectacle:
it was a good fight&mdash;this sharp, unceasing struggle
between mere human nature, young, vigorous, sane,
indefatigable, and an upright soul full of tenderness,
yet forced to live in constant warfare. Awe, too, had
mingled in Reckage's sensations while he looked on;
something of pity and terror stirred under the callous
muscle which he called his heart at the sight of a
voiceless, stifled despair outside the range of his personal
experience, though not entirely beyond his sympathy.
All men did not love after this fashion, he knew, but
humanity was full of surprises, and he had been too
calm a student of other men's lives to feel astonishment
at any fresh revelation either of their pain, their perversity,
or their humours. He had felt so sure, however,
that Robert would, in the end, get the better of
that unhappy attachment; everything in the process
of time had to surrender to reason, and it was not
possible, he thought, that a strong, self-reliant man
could long remain subdued by a mere infatuation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;And why doesn't he think of his health?&#8221; insisted
Reckage; &#8220;it is really going between all this sleeplessness,
and fasting, and over-work. Flesh and blood
cannot bear the strain. He is never idle for one
moment. He is afraid of brooding.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was with these sentiments of fear for the one
creature he believed in, and hostility toward the
woman who had presumed to interfere with the
progress of that clear spirit, that he found himself at
Almouth House. The blinds of the dining-room
were but partially down. He could see the menservants
within preparing the table which, set for two
covers, showed a pretty display of cut-glass, flowers,
old silver, and shining damask under the yellow rays
of the lit candles. Some family portraits by Gainsborough
and Reynolds, a Holbein, and a Vandyck,
with lamps shining like footlights beneath them,
were darkly visible on the dull blue walls. The
famous mantelpiece inlaid with uncut turquoise was
also within sight; and the sideboard with its load of
Sèvres china and gold dishes. Reckage took great
pride in these possessions, but it shocked his sense of
dignity to see them thus exposed to the vulgar gaze.</p>

<p>He let himself into the mansion with a latchkey,
stormed at the servants for their carelessness, and
made what is commonly known as a scene.</p>

<p>Then he crossed the hall, and went into another
fine room, which led by steps into a garden, and
caught the sunset.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>
<p>Here, standing by the window with his back to the
door, looking at the clouds, greyer than a gull's wing,
which fled like driven souls across the sky, stood
Orange.</p>

<p>He turned as the latch moved, and Reckage, coming
in, perceived the pale face, resolute, a little proud, and
thoroughly inscrutable of his former secretary. Of
fine height and broad-shouldered, Robert bore himself
with peculiar firmness and ease. His brown eyes,
with their brilliant, defiant glance, his close, dark
beard, and powerful aquiline features; the entire
absence of vanity, or the desire to produce an impression
which showed itself in every line of his face
and every movement of his body, indicated a type of
individual more likely to attract the confidence of
men than the sentimentality of women.</p>

<p>The two young men greeted each other pleasantly,
but with a certain reserve on each side.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you are here!&#8221; said Reckage, seating himself.
&#8220;I am sorry to be late. The fact is I caught sight of
old Garrow and Sara de Treverell driving together in
the Park, and it suddenly occurred to me to ask
'em to dine with us to-night. I raced after their
brougham, but my brute of a horse&mdash;Pluto: you
know the beast&mdash;gave me such a lot of trouble that I
couldn't speak to them. How are you? You don't
look very fit. Perhaps you are glad that we are alone.
But Sara is a nice girl, and full of kindness. She's a
good friend, too&mdash;just the friend for your wife. I
thought of that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert resumed his post at the window, and studied
the heavens. But if he sought for any answer to the
many impassioned questions which were thronging his
heart and mind at that moment, he looked in vain.
For himself the struggles of the last year had been to
a great degree subconscious. He had been like a sick
man who, ignorant of the real gravity of his condition,
fights death daily without a thought of the unequal
strife, or the suspense of his physicians. He had
abandoned himself to study, immersed himself in
work; he was neither morbid nor an amorist; and
while he felt a stinging misery for ever in his heart, he
bore it with manly reticence, without complaint,
without despair. Love, in his case, had meant the
idealisation of the whole of life&mdash;the life of action and
the life within the soul. It had transfigured the
world, lit up and illumined every dark corner,
answered every turbulent doubt. From the habit of
this wholly mental emotion, he had lost, little by little,
the sense of the actual bodily existence of the woman
herself. It is true that he thought of her always as
some one modestly beautiful, of childish form, with a
face like a water-nymph's&mdash;imperious, magical, elusive,
yet, whenever he found himself in her presence, she
seemed further away than when they were, in fact, apart.
The kiss he had given her on the day of their betrothal
had been as strange, indefinable, and irrealisable as the
passing of one hour into the next. There had been
the time before he kissed her, there was the time
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>afterwards, but the transition had been so swift, and
so little recognised, so inevitable, that while it drew
both their lives down deep into the wild, pitiless surge
of human feeling, she still remained more dearly and
completely his by intuition than when he held her&mdash;a
true woman&mdash;in his arms. The moral training of a
lifetime, the unceasing, daily discipline of a mind
indulgent to others, but most severe with itself, had
given him a self-mastery in impulse and desire which,
although the aspect of affairs had changed, he could
not easily, or even willingly, relax. His soul drew
back from its new privileges, sweet as they were&mdash;and
he was too honest to deny their overpowering
sweetness&mdash;they seemed like the desecration of a most
sacred thought. Vainly he reasoned, vainly he admitted
the folly of such scruples. They remained.
Asceticism is a faithful quality. It is won by slow
and painful stages, with bitter distress and mortifying
tears, but once really gained, the losing is even harder
than the struggle for its acquisition.</p>

<p>And so the young man found himself in that hard
position when judgment and prejudice stand opposed
so utterly that victory either way must mean a lasting
regret. Perhaps he was not the first bridegroom who
felt loath, on the eve of his marriage, to change the
delicate, almost ethereal tenderness of betrothed lovers
for the close and intimate association of husband and
wife. The one relationship has something in it immaterial,
exquisite, and unearthly, a bond invisible and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>yet as potent as the winds we cannot see and the
melodies we only hear. The other, with its profound
appeals to mortality, its demands upon all that is
strongest in affection and eternal in courage, its irreparableness,
suffering, and constancy, might, indeed,
have the grandeur of all human tragedy, and the
dignity of a holy state; but that it could ever be so
beautiful as the love which is a silent influence was
to Robert then, at least, an inconceivable idea. He
felt upon him and around him, in his flesh and in his
spirit, in the air and in the whole world, the all-enveloping
shadow of remorse. The dormant possibilities
of his own fanatical nature rose up before him&mdash;pale,
inarticulate fiercenesses crushed so long, and
now trembling eagerly under his breath at the prospect
of a little more liberty in loving. A suspicion
that already he loved perhaps too well and far
too passionately thrilled through his conscience, and
tortured a heart to whom thought was a refuge and
feeling a martyrdom.</p>

<p>Reckage, watching Robert from a corner of the
room, grew irritated at the silence, and wondered,
with a cruel and jealous curiosity, what was passing in
his mind. He wondered whether he was praying. An
impulse, which had something in it of brute fury, urged
him to tear open that still face and drag the thoughts
behind it to the light. Why was it that one could
never, by any sense, enter into another's spirit? The
same torturing mystery had often disturbed him during
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>the half-hours&mdash;outwardly placid and commonplace&mdash;which
he spent, out of etiquette, with his future bride.
She, too, retired behind the veil of her countenance to
live a hidden life that he could never hope to join.
How lonely was companionship in these conditions,
and how desolate marriage!</p>

<p>He could not resist the temptation to break in, with
a touch of crude satire, upon his friend's solitude.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter?&#8221; he exclaimed, &#8220;are you
hungry?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Robert, so well accustomed to such
violent jars that they could no longer disturb him;
&#8220;I was only thinking....&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;About what?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All sorts of things.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reckage turned pale from dissatisfied inquisitiveness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think, too,&#8221; he answered, &#8220;but I can throw
out a word now and again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, making the remark that he was not dressed
for dinner, he left the room.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p><h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V</h2>


<p>The dinner, in the ordering of which the host had
expended all his gastronomical knowledge and much
anxiety, seemed long. Orange found himself opposite
the famous portrait of &#8220;Edwyn, Lord Reckage of
Almouth,&#8221; which represents that nobleman elaborately
dressed, reclining on a grassy bank by a spring of
water, with a wooded landscape, a sunrise, and a
squire holding two horses in the distance. Robert
studied, and remembered always, every detail of that
singular composition. The warrior's shield, with its
motto &#8220;<i>Magica sympathia</i>,&#8221; his fat white hands,
velvet breeches, steel cuirass, and stiff lace collar
remained for days a grotesque image before his
mind. He traced, too, a certain resemblance between
Reckage and that ancestor&mdash;they both wore pointed
red beards, both were fair of skin, both had a dreaming
violence in their blue eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must have some pheasant,&#8221; said his lordship,
at last. &#8220;You are eating nothing. And that
Burgundy, you know, is unique of its kind. It was
a present from the Emperor of the French to mamma.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>Her people were civil to him when he was regarded
as a sort of adventurer. And he never forgot it.
He's a very decent fellow. I dined with him at the
Tuileries&mdash;did I mention it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert replied that he fancied he had heard of the
occurrence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; continued his friend, &#8220;I might have
enjoyed that experience, but I was feeling depressed
at the time; a lot of the depression went under the
influence of frivolous talk, military music, and champagne.
Yet, all the same, do these things really
count for much? I felt just as wretched afterwards.&#8221;</p>

<p>The glimpse he had obtained that afternoon of Sara
de Treverell&mdash;Sara flushed with agitation, very bright
in her glance, exceedingly subtle in her smile, had
stirred a great tenderness he had once felt for that
young lady. The news, too, that she had been
chosen as a bride by the prudent, rich, and most
important Duke of Marshire made his lordship feel
that perhaps he had committed a blunder in not
having secured her, during her first season, for himself.
He feared that he had lost an opportunity;
and this reflection, while it lowered temporarily his
self-esteem, placed Sara on a dangerous eminence.
She would be a duchess&mdash;one of the great duchesses.
Little Sara!</p>

<p>&#8220;She was looking extraordinarily handsome,&#8221; he
exclaimed. &#8220;Of course she means to take him.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>But she liked me at one time. I am speaking of
Sara de Treverell. Marshire is by way of being a
stick. Who could have imagined him going in for
a high-spirited, brilliant girl like Sara?&#8221;</p>

<p>Formerly he had always spoken of Sara as a clever
little devil, but Robert showed no surprise at the new
adjective.</p>

<p>&#8220;Brilliant!&#8221; repeated his lordship. &#8220;Don't you
agree?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Absolutely. She is the most brilliant girl in
London.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But heartless,&#8221; said his lordship pathetically;
&#8220;she hasn't one bit of heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There I don't agree with you. Of course she is
strange and rather wild.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Tête-montée.</i> And then the Asiatic streak!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True. The fiercest wind cannot take the angles
out of the bough of a tree an inch thick. You may
break it, but you cannot destroy its angles. That is
so, no doubt, with one's racial tendencies. The girl
is wilful and romantic. It will be very bad for them
both if there is no love on her side. She is capable, I
should say, of very deep affection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She did like me,&#8221; said his lordship, with emphasis
and satisfaction&mdash;&#8220;she really did. And I wouldn't
encourage it. I had no notion then of marrying.
Her singularity, too, made me cautious. I couldn't
believe in her. She talked like an actress in a play.
I felt that she was not the woman for me. Essentially
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>she thought as I did, and seemed to comprehend my
embarrassment. The worst of it is now&mdash;I may have
been wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I doubt it. You may be sure, on the whole, that
your instincts were right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still, there is a distinct misgiving. I was drawn
toward her, and, when I made up my mind to put an
end to the matter, our friendship was severely strained.
But it was not broken. Something I saw in her face
to-day makes me sure that it was not broken.&#8221;</p>

<p>While he was speaking the servant entered with
a salver, and on the salver was a note. The address
showed Sara's large, defiant hand-writing. Reckage,
who had a touch of superstition in his nature, changed
colour and even hesitated before he broke the seal.
The coincidence seemed extraordinary and fatal.
What did it mean? He read the letter with an
irresistible feeling of proud delight.</p>

<blockquote><p class="i8">&#8220;<span class="smcap">20a, St. James's Square</span>, W.</p><p class="nospaceabove">&#8220;<span class="smcap">My dear Beauclerk</span>,&mdash;Will you lunch with us to-morrow
at two o'clock? Papa has invited a friend&mdash;a
dreadful, boring friend&mdash;who has been absent from
England for five years. Do you know the man? Sir
Piers Harding? But I want some one to encourage me.
You? Do!</p><p class="i8">&#8220;Yours sincerely,</p><p class="i12 nospaceabove">&#8220;S. L. V. <span class="smcap">de Treverell</span>.</p><p>&#8220;P.S.&mdash;I am so happy about you and Agnes. Be kind
to her always? Won't you?&#8221;</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<p>All his life he had found a difficulty in understanding
women&mdash;the significance of their words, the
precise translation of their glances, and their motives
generally. He had nourished his experience on French
novels; he had corrected it by various friendships; he
had crowned it with the confession that one could
never tell what the sex meant one way or the other.
But this fact remained&mdash;he was a coxcomb, and,
whenever he owned himself puzzled, it was on a
single ground only&mdash;how seriously was the lady at
stake affected by his charms? Feeling, as he did,
the infinite inequality that existed between men, and
conscious of his own reputation as a leader among
them, it was not in his conscience to encourage any
woman whom he did not find especially attractive
or useful. Why spoil her chances? Why make her
discontented with the average male creature? Had
Sara written to him in ordinary circumstances, inviting
him, after some months of mutual coldness,
to lunch, he would have replied, with sorrowful
dignity, that it was wiser to leave things as they
were. But the case had altered. The future
Duchess of Marshire was a personage. He made
no secret of his admiration for all people of high
rank. They represented influence and traditions;
what was more, they could exercise a certain power,
and introduce, when necessary, the ideas upon
which fresh traditions could be based. A friend
like Sara de Treverell with her new honours
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>made life itself more rich to him. When he remembered
that she was young, handsome, enthusiastic,
and impulsive, his pleasure thrilled into something of
genuine passion. He told himself that he had always
been fond of the girl; that hundreds of times he had
felt the hardness of his scrupulous position where she
was concerned. If he had been asked what especially
he conceived his own duty to be now, he would have
said that it was not for him to hang back when she
showed a coming spirit. But this was not all. He
was a gamester; he was ambitious.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is very odd,&#8221; said he, reading Sara's note for
the second time, &#8220;very odd. There's no harm in
showing it to you, because there is nothing in it.&#8221;</p>

<p>He gave it to his friend, and ate, pleasantly, while
Orange glanced down the page. His soul's wish was
to be left alone. The effort of forcing himself&mdash;not
to affect but honestly to feel&mdash;an interest in Reckage's
conversation had proved successful. He had indeed
put aside his own thoughts, and followed, with the
exaggerated earnestness of a mind determined on self-sacrifice,
every word his companion had uttered.
The spirit invisible wears the laurel of mental
victories, but the body has to bear the exhaustion, the
scars, and the soreness. He was tired, but he stirred
himself again to consider Sara's note. In the course
of that year she had written several letters to Orange&mdash;letters
about books, new pictures, and new music.
Once she had given him a little song of her own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>composition as something of which she &#8220;desired to
hear no more for ever.&#8221; The song was sentimental, and
he locked it away, wondering at the time whether she
really had an unfortunate affection for Lord Reckage.
But in reading her note that evening he decided against
his original fear. Women did not write in that strain
to men whom they loved, or had ever loved ... even
passably well. He returned it to the owner with this
comment&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;A woman, you know, is like your shadow: run
away from her and she follows you; run after her and
she flies from you. That's an old saying. It is true
so long as she does not love the man. And when she
loves the man&mdash;well, then she ceases to be a shadow.
She becomes a living thing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is no answer at all. If you could read her
heart and whole thought at this moment, what would
you see there?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Unhappiness,&#8221; said Robert; &#8220;discontent.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reckage took the little sheet and folded it into his
pocket-book.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's wonderful,&#8221; said he, &#8220;because the same
things are in my mind, too. I wish I could describe
my feelings about Agnes. She satisfies the æsthetic
side of my nature. But there is another side. And
Sara comes nearer to it than she. Mind you, I know
my duty in the matter. There are things which one
is compelled to do under tremendous penalties. I have
chosen, and I must abide by my choice.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert looked well at his friend, and saw, in his
expression, all that he had known would inevitably,
either soon or too late, work to the surface.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet the old tremulous affection lies in me,&#8221; continued
Reckage; &#8220;my nerves are in a kind of blaze.
You couldn't tell anything about it, because you don't
know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Emperor's burgundy, no doubt, had warmed
his spirit to communicativeness. He drew his chair
closer to the table, and talked in a low voice about his
ghastly solitude of soul. His engagement to Miss
Carillon had not been an agreeable experience.</p>

<p>&#8220;And marriage,&#8221; said he, &#8220;will be the crowning
point of these unbearable days. In the present state
of my feelings it would be awful. Agnes is very
kind and most conscientious, but she does not know
what is in me, what was always and will always be
there. Old reminiscences crowd round me. They
are very beautiful, although they are so sad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is one to do?&#8221; said Robert, &#8220;in the presence
of fate and facts? It is necessary to look the affair in
the face. Do you, or don't you, wish to marry Miss
Carillon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, and I don't,&#8221; answered Reckage doggedly.
&#8220;But I can't close my eyes to the circumstances of
the case. I found myself hard bested from the very
beginning. I knew that I was expected to marry her.
I knew, too, that it was a suitable match in every way.
But then every girl is, to some extent, accomplished,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>pious, virtuous, and intelligent. I believe sometimes
that my apparent indifference towards Agnes arises
from the fact that I respect her&mdash;if anything&mdash;too
much. She seems too remote&mdash;that is the word&mdash;for
the ordinary wear and tear of domesticity. Other
men&mdash;who might be called impassioned lovers&mdash;would
be less scrupulous. I maintain that devotion of that
violent kind is worth absolutely nothing. And I claim
to know a little about life and love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should say,&#8221; said Orange, &#8220;that you knew more
about mere physiology.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reckage laughed uneasily.</p>

<p>&#8220;You keep your mediæval views!&#8221; said he. &#8220;Perhaps
I envy you. I can't say. I don't think I envy
any one. I am quite contented.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what are you driving at?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh well, a fellow must think. You see, Sara suits
me, in a sense. I am not afraid of her. Now a wife
is a sacred object. You might as well flirt with the
Ten Commandments as fall in love with your wife. I
say, never begin love-making with the lady you hope
to marry. It will end in disaster. Because the day
must come when she will wonder why you have
changed. No, a wife should be the one woman in the
world with whom you can spend days and weeks of
unreproved coldness.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were now smoking, and the tobacco seemed
to produce a tranquillising effect upon his lordship. He
closed his lips and amused himself by puffing rings of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>smoke into the air. When he next spoke, he suggested
a visit to the theatre. He had engaged a box
for the new burlesque, &#8220;<i>The Blue Princess</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be very good, and it will cheer us up,&#8221;
said he.</p>

<p>Orange was in no mood for the entertainment, but
Reckage's evident misery seemed to require a fresh
scene. The streets, as they left the house, were full
of a deep purple fog, through which shone out, with a
dull and brazen gleam, the lights of lamps and passing
carriages. Above them, the sky was but a pall or
vapour; the air, charged with the emotions, the struggling
energy, the cruelty, confusion, painfulness, and
unceasing agitation of life in a vast city, was damp and
stifling; a noise of traffic&mdash;as loud but not so terrible
as a breaking storm&mdash;destroyed the peace of night;
there were foot passengers of every age and description
moving like rooks in the wind, over the pavement,
and vehicles filled with men and women&mdash;an irremediable
pilgrimage bound, for the greater part, on pleasure.
Robert felt that he would have given gladly the treasures
of a universe for just the time to think a little
while of his own love. So far that great attachment
had brought him aberrations, sorrow, and perplexities;
all its sweetness had flown, moth-like, into his heart,
there to be burnt&mdash;burnt yet left unburied: all its
happiness had glorified his life against his will; all its
beauty had been starved with a pitiless rigour. What
then had remained? A certain state of mind&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>passionate resignation to its own indomitable cravings.
And now on the eve of his marriage&mdash;a marriage never
so much as imagined, far less hoped for&mdash;he could not
have the leisure to behold, through tears of relief,
the complete transformation of his destiny&mdash;once so
frightful, now so joyous. The theatre was crowded,
and when the two young men entered their box
the burlesque was at the beginning of the second
act. The scene represented an orange grove by
moonlight, and a handsome girl in spangled muslin
was whispering loudly, to an accompaniment of harps,
her eternal fidelity to a gesticulating troubadour. Both
performers were immensely popular, and the duet,
with its refrain&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Love, I will love thee always,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For ever is not too long;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Love, e'en in dark and dreary days,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">This shall be my one song,&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>was repeated three times to the smiling, serene, and
thoroughly convinced audience. Reckage, who
attended public places of amusement solely from the
desire of exhibiting himself, gave but a side-glance at
the stage and turned his opera glass upon the auditorium.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, town is very full,&#8221; said he; &#8220;I suppose
many of them are up for the Hauconberg wedding.
There's old Cliddesdon&mdash;just look at him. Did you
ever see such an infernal ass? Hullo! I thought that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>Millie Warfield wouldn't be far off. She's a perfect
rack of bones. Lady Michelmarsh is getting rather
pretty&mdash;it's wonderful how these dowdy girls can
work up their profiles after a month or two in town.
She was a lump as a bride&mdash;a regular lump. You
never met anything like it. Aumerle is talking to
her now. He was at the Capitol this afternoon. He
begins to give himself airs. I can't stand him. In
fact, I cannot understand those fellows on my sub-committee.
Sometimes they are&mdash;if anything&mdash;too
civil. A bit servile, in fact. Then they turn out and
look as though they would like to make their teeth
meet in my backbone. They sulk, and whisper in
groups, and snicker. I am getting sick of it. I must
get rid of them. By Jove! there's David Rennes,
the painter. I thought he was at Amesbury&mdash;with
the Carillons, doing Agnes's portrait. It can't be
finished. She said distinctly in her letter this morning&mdash;&#8220;I
may not add more because I have to give Mr.
Rennes a sitting while the light is good.&#8221; Where's
the letter? I must have left it on the breakfast-table.
Anyhow that is what she said. I'll catch Rennes' eye
and have him up. He is not a bad sort.&#8221;</p>

<p>The act-drop had now descended, the lights were
turned on to their full power, and Orange, following
the direction of Reckage's gaze, saw, in the last row of
the stalls, a large man about nine-and-thirty with
an emotional, nervous face, a heavy beard, and dense
black hair. He was leaning forward, for the seat in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>front of him was, at the moment, vacant; his hands
were tightly locked, his eyes fixed on the curtain. At
last Reckage's determined stare produced its effect.
He moved, glanced toward the box, and, in response
to his lordship's signal, left his place. Two minutes
later Orange heard a tap at the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;That's right,&#8221; said Reckage, as Rennes entered,
&#8220;take Orange's chair. He doesn't care a bit about
the play, or anything in it. He is going to get
married to-morrow. You know Robert Orange,
don't you? You ought to paint him. Saint Augustine
with a future. <i>Mon devoir, mes livres, et puis ... et
puis, madame, ma femme.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>The Emperor's burgundy, indeed, had not been
opened in vain. Rennes could talk well, sometimes
brilliantly, often with originality, and, with the tact of
all highly sensitive beings, he led the conversation
into impersonal themes. He said Miss Carillon's
portrait was not yet finished, but he changed that
subject immediately, and the evening, which had been
to Orange a trial of patience, ended rather better
than it began. Lord Reckage invited Rennes to
accompany them home. The artist did not appear,
at first, in the mood to accept that invitation. He,
too, seemed to have many things he wished to think
about undisturbed, and in the silence of his own
company. His hesitation passed, however; the kindness
in his nature had been roused by something
unusual, haunting, ominous in Robert's face.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I will come,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>All the way, on their walk to Almouth House, he
kept Reckage amused. Orange never once felt
under the necessity to speak. He was able to dream,
to hold his breath, to remember that he loved and
was loved again, that he would see her to-morrow&mdash;to-morrow
quite early, and then, no more unutterable
farewells, heart-desolating separations. He surprised
himself by saying aloud&mdash;&#8220;I love you ... I love
you.&#8221; The two men, engrossed in talk, did not hear
him. But he had caught the words, and it seemed
as though he heard his own voice for the first
time.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must want some supper,&#8221; said Reckage&mdash;&#8220;a
rum omelette.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! no! I couldn't.&#8221;</p>

<p>He sat down to the table, however, and watched
them eat. First the burlesque was discussed, then the
actresses, the dresses, the dancing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Russia is the place for dancing,&#8221; said Reckage,
&#8220;I assure you. There was a dancer at Petersburg.... Something-or-other-<i>ewski</i>
was her name, and
a fellow shot himself while I was there on her account.
An awful fool. I can tell you who painted
her portrait. A Frenchman called Carolus-Duran. I
believe he has a career before him. What is your
opinion of French art?&#8221;</p>

<p>Rennes had studied in Paris and was well acquainted
with the artist in question. They talked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>about the exhibitions of the year and the prices paid
at a recent sale of pictures.</p>

<p>&#8220;Old Garrow has some fine pictures,&#8221; said Reckage.
&#8220;I would give a good deal for his Ghirlandajo.
Do you know it? And then that noble Tintoret?
There are so many persons whose position in life
compels them to encourage art without having any
real enjoyment of it. Garrow is one of those persons.
But his daughter, Lady Sara, has a touch of
genius. She's a musician. You have heard her play,
haven't you, Robert?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert had, at that instant, observed upon the
mantelpiece a letter addressed to himself. It was
from Brigit. He grew pale, and retired, with the
little envelope lightly written on, to a far corner of the
room. For some moments he could not break the
seal. The sight of her writing filled him with a kind
of agony&mdash;something beyond his control, beyond his
comprehension. What did it mean&mdash;this tightening of
the heart, this touch of fear, and love, and fear again,
so deep that the whole web of life trembled and its
strings grew confused one with another, and all was
anguish, darkness, self-renunciation, and a wild, a
dreadful mystery of human influence? At last he
opened the letter.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My dearest</span>,&#8221; it began, &#8220;I can never say all that
I wish to say, because when I am with you I forget
everything and watch your face. When I am away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>from you I forget your face, and I long to see it again
in order that I may remember it more perfectly! It
is so hard not to think of you too often. But I have
had a great deal of sorrow, and everything I have in
the world&mdash;except you&mdash;is a grief. I know that we
are not born to be happy, and so, I wonder, have we
stolen our happiness? If it is a gift&mdash;I know not what
to do with it. I cannot speak a happy language: the
atmosphere is strange and frightens me. Dear Robert,
I am terrified, uncertain, but when we meet to-morrow
you will give me courage. And then, as we shall not
part again, I need never again be, as I am now, too
anxious. Your <span class="smcap">Brigit</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Reckage's voice broke in again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do wish you would try this rum omelette. It is
capital.&#8221;</p>

<p>Orange laughed, but left the room. Rennes remarked
that he had a powerful face.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He has a strong character. And he would
never deceive another. But he deceives himself hourly&mdash;daily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In what way?&#8221; asked Rennes.</p>

<p>&#8220;He doesn't know,&#8221; said Reckage, &#8220;what a devilish
fine chap he is! I wish to God that I could prevent
this marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I say nothing against Mrs. Parflete. She's a high-class
woman and so on. Awfully beautiful, too. As
clever as they make 'em, and not a breath against her.
All the same, I am not very sweet on love matches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>for men of Orange's calibre. They never answer&mdash;never.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't agree with you there,&#8221; replied the artist,
&#8220;because I believe that a love match&mdash;even when it
dissolves, as it may, into a mistake&mdash;is the best thing
that can happen to any man.&#8221;</p>

<p>After this they discussed bindings. Lord Reckage
was the first amateur authority on the subject.</p>

<p>At five the next morning Robert was writing letters.
Then, as soon as the gates of Hyde Park were open, he
walked out. The recurrence of familiar sentiments on
the essentials that make up the condition known as
happiness would neither convince, nor inspire, the
powers of an imagination which, with all its richness,
was, apart from the purely artistic faculty, analytical
and foreboding. Self-doubt, however, has no part in
passion. Of the many miseries it may bring, this,
perhaps the worst of human woes, can never be in its
train. Men in love&mdash;and women also&mdash;may distrust
all things and all creatures, but their own emotion, like
the storm, proves the reality of its force by the
mischief it wreaks. Robert's spirit, borne along by
this vehemence of feeling, caught the keen sweetness
of the early air, not yet infected by the day's traffic.
His melancholy&mdash;the inevitable melancholy produced
by sustained thought on any subject, whether sublime
or simple&mdash;was dispelled. The Park, which was empty
but for a few men on their way to work, and
runners anxious to keep in training, had its great trees
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>still beautiful from the lingering glance of summer;
the wide and misty stretches of grey grass were fresh
in dew; the softness and haze&mdash;without the gloom&mdash;of
autumn were in the atmosphere. The pride of love
requited and the instincts of youth could not resist
these spells of nature. Robert remembered only that
it was his wedding-day: that every throb of his pulse
and every second of time brought him nearer to the
supreme joy of his life and the supreme moment. He
had never used his nerves with bliss and tears, and he
did not belong to the large army of young gentlemen
who own themselves proudly</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&#8220;Light half-believers of our casual creeds,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And lose to-morrow the ground won to-day.&#8221;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This view of heroism was not possible to him, and he
was too strong in mind and body to pretend to it.
The two things which affect a career most profoundly
are religion, or the lack of it, and marriage&mdash;or not
marrying; for these things only penetrate to the soul
and make what may be called its perpetual atmosphere.
The Catholic Faith, which ignores no single possibility
in human feeling and no possible flight in human
idealism, produces in those who hold it truly a freshness
of heart very hard to be understood by the dispassionate
critic who weighs character by the newest laws of his
favourite degenerate, but never by the primeval tests
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>of God. Robert, therefore, was thinking of his
bride's face, the pure curves of her mouth, her sapphirine
eyes, her pretty hands, her golden hair, the
nose which others found fault with, which he, nevertheless,
thought wholly delightful. He wondered what
she would say and how she would look when they met.
Would she be pale? Would she be frightened? There
had always been a certain agony in every former meeting
because of the farewell which had to follow. With
all his habits of self-control, he had never been able to
feel quite sure that the word too much would not be
said, that the glance too long would not be given.
Her own simplicity, he told himself, had saved him
from disaster. She showed her affection so fearlessly&mdash;with
such tender and discerning trust&mdash;that his worst
struggles were in solitude&mdash;not in her presence at all.
It was when he was away from her immediate peaceful
influence that the fever, the restlessness, the torments
and the desperation (has not old Burton summed up
for us the whole situation and all the symptoms in his
&#8220;<i>Anatomy</i>&#8221;?) had to be endured and conquered. These
trials now&mdash;for even a sense of humour could not make
them less than trials&mdash;were ended. The tragi-comic
labour of walking too much and riding too much,
working and smoking too much, thinking and sleeping
too little&mdash;the whole dreary business, in fact, of stifling
any absorbing idea or ruling passion, would be no
more.</p>

<p>When he returned to Almouth House, Reckage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>was already dressed for his official duties as &#8220;best
man.&#8221; He felt an unwonted and genuine excitement
about Robert's marriage. He put aside the languor,
<i>ennui</i>, and depression which he felt too easily on most
occasions, and, that day at least, he was, as his own
servant expressed it, &#8220;nervous and cut-up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall miss the swimming, the boxing, the
fencing, and the pistol practice,&#8221; he complained, referring
to diversions in which Orange was an expert
and himself the bored but dutiful participant. &#8220;They
nearly always drop these things when they marry.&#8221;
The loss he really feared was the moral support and
affection of his former secretary&mdash;advantages which a
selfish nature is slow to appreciate, yet most tenacious
of when once convinced of their use. The nuptial
mass had been fixed for eight o'clock, the wedding
party were to breakfast at Almouth House afterwards,
then the bride and groom were to leave by the mail
for Southampton <i>en route</i> for Miraflores in Northern
France. The two young men drove together to the
chapel attached to the Alberian Embassy. Not a
word passed between them, but Reckage, under his
eyelids, examined every detail of his friend's attire.
He wondered at its satisfactoriness on the whole, inasmuch
as Orange had not seen fit to consult him on
the point. The church was small and grey and
sombre; the flowers on the altar (sent by his lordship)
were all white; their perfume filled the building.</p>

<p>&#8220;They look very nice,&#8221; said Reckage, &#8220;and in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>excellent taste. Some of these old pictures on the
wall are uncommonly good, and I particularly like that
bronze crucifix. Ten to one if it isn't genuine
eleventh century. I will ask the old fellow afterwards.
He's a dear. His Latin is lovely. It's an
artistic pleasure to hear him read the Gospel. I
looked in the other morning, just to get the run, as it
were, of the place. By Jove! Here they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pensée Fitz Rewes came first&mdash;very graceful in
lavender silk, and accompanied by her little boy, who
showed by an unconscious anxiety of expression that
he felt instinctively his mother's air of contentment
was assumed. Then Baron Zeuill, with Brigit on
his arm, followed. The Baron looked grave&mdash;too
grave for the happy circumstances. Brigit seemed as
pale as the lilies on the altar; she was less beautiful
but more ethereal than usual. There was something
frail, transparent, unsubstantial about her that day
which Robert had never noticed before. Had the
many emotional strains of the last year tried her
delicate youth beyond endurance? She seemed very
childish, too, and immature. She took Orange's hand
when he met her, held it closely, and watched the
others with a kind of wonder most pitiful to witness&mdash;as
though she had suffered too much from her
contact with life and could no more. Her eyes seemed
darker than the sapphires to which Robert had so
often compared them: this effect, he told himself, was
due to the strong contrast given by the pallor of her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>face. It was quite clear, however, that she was not
under the influence then of any dominant thought.
Her nerves and senses were strained to that extreme
tension resembling apathy, until the vibration given
by some touch or tone sets the whole system trembling
with all the spiritual and bodily forces which make the
mystery of human life. She spoke her responses,
signed the register, and walked out from the church
on Robert's arm without a single change of countenance
or token of feeling. As they drove away
from the church, she flushed a little and drew far
back, with a new timidity, into her corner. One look
she gave of perfect love and confidence. She pressed
his hand and held it, for a moment, against her cheek.
But neither of them spoke. And indeed, what was
there to be said? The identification of their two
minds had been full and absolute from the moment of
their first encounter long ago in Chambord. The
accidental differences of sex and age, training, accomplishments,
and education had not affected&mdash;and could
not affect&mdash;a sympathy in temperament which depended&mdash;not
on the similarity of opinions&mdash;but on a
similarity of moral fibre. Many forms can be cut, by
the same hand, from the same piece of marble, and
although one may be a grotesque and the other a
cross, one a pursuing goddess and the other an angel
for a tomb, the same substance, light, touch, and
colour will be characteristic of all four. Marriage, at
best, could but give a certain crude emphasis to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>strange spiritual bond which united these two beings.
Practical as they both were in the common affairs of
life, they shrank from anything which would promise
to materialise the subtleties of the mind. Some
thoughts, they felt, were as impalpable as sounds,
and, just as music ceases to be divine when it is
poured out of some mechanical contrivance, so the
mysteries of the human soul become mere bodily conditions&mdash;more
or less humiliating&mdash;when demonstrated,
catalogued, and legalised. There is nothing modern
nor uncommon in this especial disposition. One may
describe it as ascetic, anæmic, sentimental, hysterical,
neurotic; but the men and women who possess this
fragile organism show, as a rule, powers of endurance
and a strength of will by no means characteristic of
the average sanguine and sensual creature who eats,
drinks, fights, loves, and does his best in a world which
he calls vile, yet would not renounce for all the
ecstasies of Paradise.</p>

<p>The carriage wheels rolled on&mdash;as swift and noiseless
as the sand in an hour-glass. Why was the road
so short? Why could they not be carried thus for
ever, tranquil with happiness, wanting nothing, seeking
nothing, bound no-whither? Foolish questions and
a foolish longing: yet happiness consists in being able
to formulate wishes with the serene knowledge that
a better wisdom directs their fulfilment. Neither
passers-by nor other vehicles, neither houses nor streets
caught the entranced attention of these young lovers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>The delight of being purely self-absorbed is very great
and intoxicating to those who are constantly&mdash;either
by desire or the force of circumstances&mdash;unselfish. A
faint flush swept into Brigit's face under the effect of
an experience so novel. Their twofold consciousness
had all the pathos of self-effacement, and all the thrill
of satisfied egoism. Such instants cannot last, and
they are shortest when one's habits of thought are
antagonistic to such luxury. Brigit sighed deeply,
and roused herself with a painful sense that the minute
she wilfully cut short had been the sweetest in her life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pensée,&#8221; she said, &#8220;has been so kind to me. She
gave me her room at Wight House last night. She
had the little dressing-room just off it. Did you notice
her dress? She was very anxious that you should
like it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She seemed all right,&#8221; said Robert; &#8220;and wasn't
Reckage splendid?&#8221;</p>

<p>Having spoilt their perfect moment, they became
as mere mortals, more at ease in this planet, where
complete joy has an unfamiliar mien. Brigit's
actual physical beauty returned. The sunshine stole
in at the open window and lit up her golden hair,
which was half hidden by a hat with white plumes.
She looked down at her hand with its new wedding
ring, and was pleasantly aware of Robert's admiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so glad,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;that you think
my hand is nice. Because I have given it to you for
all time. And if you are ever tired, or discouraged,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>or unhappy, or lonely, and you want me, I shall come
to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you will be with me now always.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;Yes, Robert, always.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had now reached Almouth House. Her little
foot, with its arched instep, seemed too slight and delicate
for the pavement. Robert knew that her arm rested
upon his, because he felt it trembling. They crossed
the threshold together. The doors closed after them.</p>

<p>&#8220;And he never once kissed her on the way from
church!&#8221; exclaimed the footman.</p>

<p>But the coachman did not think this very peculiar.
&#8220;I don't hold with kissing,&#8221; said he; &#8220;to my mind
there's nothing in it. Kissing is for boys and gals&mdash;not
for men and wives.&#8221;</p>

<p>Baron Zeuill was unable to join them all at
breakfast, but Pensée, and Reckage, and David
Rennes (who had been especially invited the night
before because he had proved so entertaining), did more
than their duty as friends by talking feverishly, eating
immoderately, and affecting the conventional joyousness
universally thought proper at such times. Pensée
ventured to make a reference to the forthcoming
marriage of the &#8220;best man,&#8221; and expressed the faltering
hope that &#8220;dear Agnes would be as happy as dear
Brigit.&#8221; Reckage scowled. Rennes was seized with
a fit of coughing. It was the one unlucky hit in the
whole conversation, and it was soon forgotten by
every one present except Orange, who remembered it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>frequently in later days. At last the hour for departure
came. Pensée, weeping, kissed Brigit on both cheeks,
looked into her grave eyes long and lovingly, put her
arms around the slight, girlish form with that exquisite,
indefinable tenderness, unconscious, unpremeditated,
and protective, which married women show toward
very youthful brides. Robert handed his wife into
the brougham, the order was given &#8220;To Waterloo,&#8221;
the horses started, rice and slippers were thrown.</p>

<p>&#8220;They go into the world for the first time,&#8221; exclaimed
Rennes.</p>

<p>Then Pensée was assisted into the barouche, and
drove homewards.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall meet again,&#8221; she said, as she parted from
Reckage; &#8220;we meet at Sara's at lunch.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two men were thus left alone. They decided
to smoke, for they were both a little affected by the
pathos of the situation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Explain Robert,&#8221; said his lordship, as they returned
to the dining-room, &#8220;explain that kind of love.
You are an artist.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, it isn't my way,&#8221; rejoined the other, with a
forced laugh, &#8220;but there are many manifestations of
personal magnetism.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This kind is very interesting,&#8221; said Reckage,
&#8220;although it is, of course, high-flown. Orange is
romantic and scrupulous&mdash;he knows next to nothing
of the sensual life; and that next to nothing is merely
a source of disgust and remorse. You follow me?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perfectly,&#8221; said Rennes. &#8220;It is a question of
temperament. The wonder is that he has not entered,
in some delirium of renunciation, the priesthood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That would mean, for his gifts, a closed career.
It beats my wits to guess how this marriage will turn
out. He is madly in love. He has suffered frightfully.
Too much moral anguish has a depraving effect in the
long run.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not so sure of that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so, at any rate. Now many a decent sort
of fellow can get along well enough&mdash;if he has a
woman to his taste and wine which he considers good.
You observe I condense the situation as much as
possible. But Orange is different.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not so different&mdash;except in degree, or experience.
At present, he oscillates between the woe of love and
the joy of life. You compared him to St. Augustine.
St. Augustine never pretended that earthly happiness
was a delusion. He knew better. He said, &#8216;Do not
trust it, but seek the happiness which hath no end.&#8217;
Personally, I can accept with gratitude as much as I
can get. &#8216;Is not the life of men upon earth all trial,
without any interval?&#8217; This may be; yet it is something
to learn how to sympathise with happiness.
Our best men and women devote themselves too
exclusively to the diagnosis of misery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have thought a lot, I can see,&#8221; said Reckage.</p>

<p>The artist gave him a quick, friendly glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have played the fool,&#8221; said he. &#8220;I envy Orange.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>He will know things that I can never know&mdash;now.
I haven't lived up to my thoughts. I am not remorseful&mdash;I
don't believe in remorse. It is a thing for the
half-hearted. But if I am not sad, I am not especially
gay. The middle course between sentimentality and
gallantry seems to me intimately immoral and ridiculous
into the bargain. So I am an idealist with
senses. There are times when I hate life. And why?
Because life is evil? By no means; but because we
tell lies about it, and write lies about it, from morning
till night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem a bit depressed,&#8221; said Lord Reckage.
&#8220;But, by the by, how is the portrait going? My
brother Hercy, who paints a little, always declared
that Agnes was unpaintable. Do you find her unpaintable?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Rennes; &#8220;oh no!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII"></a>CHAPTER VII</h2>


<p>When Reckage asked Rennes whether he found Miss
Carillon &#8220;unpaintable,&#8221; the artist was conscious of a
swift, piercing emotion, which passed, indeed, but left
an ache. And as the day advanced the smart of the
wound grew more intense. A visit to the National
Gallery, a call at his tailor's, an inspection of maps at
his club, afforded little relief to the indefinable misery.
He was tortured by the disingenuousness of his own
mind. He had done so much, and thought so much,
and read so much; he could give so many scientific
reasons for each idea and each movement of his mental
and physical being, that the joy of life had been cut
up in its machinery. He had lost the power of being
natural either in his pains or his pleasures. He knew
all the answers, but not one of the questions which
trouble youth. He had never wondered at anything.
Wonder&mdash;the lovely mistress of wisdom&mdash;had taught
him none of her secrets. Dead certainty had dogged
his steps from his first appearance on this unknowable
world. Once, when a very little boy, he admired
a vase full of pink roses. &#8220;They will keep twice as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>long,&#8221; said his nurse, &#8220;in dirty water. It is such a
waste to put fresh water on roses!&#8221; This remark&mdash;slight
in itself&mdash;remained in his memory as the first
truth&mdash;the Logos, in fact&mdash;from which all other
truths generated. He was now nine-and-thirty: he
had executed an abnormal amount of work, and he
had a just reputation as a portrait-painter. His
technical skill was considered unique. The something
lacking was that mysteriousness which belongs
to all great art, and is, essentially, in life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Rennes,&#8221; said one of his friends, &#8220;can work for
sixteen hours a day. It is all taken from without.
He gives nothing except his undivided attention.&#8221;
The saying was not true; he gave himself absolutely&mdash;soul,
brain, and heart&mdash;to his task, but the gift was
too premeditated, too accurately weighed. There
was no self-abandonment, nor self-forgetfulness. His
admiration for Miss Carillon had been of this kind.
Having added up her attractions, her figure, her face,
her youth, her intelligence, her grace, he decided that
she was exceptional in many ways. He found real
happiness in her society&mdash;she was so sane, so clear, so
unaffected. His attitude toward her had remained for
some time one of fraternal affection, partly by force of
will, chiefly because his relations with other women
were not so restrained. But the position was changing.
Certain forces in life were assuming for him a complicated
and threatening aspect. What if, after all,
there was an incalculable element in man?</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Now to be practical,&#8221; he said to himself. He had
not seen his mother for a fortnight. She lived in
Kensington Square. &#8220;I must really go and see my
mother!&#8221; The cab drove quickly; the little grey
house was soon reached. David opened the door
with his latch-key and rushed upstairs into the small
drawing-room, furnished in white and green, with
fresh flowers on the mantelpiece, and many shelves of
vellum-bound books. A bronze lamp hung from the
ceiling, and its globe, covered in violet silk, cast a
light like that of the early dawn in hilly regions. A
faint odour of lavender filled the air. In one corner
of the room there was a chess-table with its chessmen
showing an interrupted game. A velvet footstool,
much indented by the pressure of a firm foot, stood in
front of the carved armchair in which Mrs. Rennes
usually sat. Her work-basket, lined with blue satin
and shining with steel fittings, stood in its customary
place on a gipsy stool near the fireplace. A few old
English prints hung on the walls, and between the
windows there was a Chippendale cabinet filled with
Worcester and Crown Derby china. The aspect of
all things was restful, emotionless, and some of its
calm seemed to overtake and soothe David's agitated
spirit. He sat down at the piano and played, with
much passion, bits from Wagner's &#8220;<i>Tristan</i>,&#8221; the first
performance of which he had seen at Munich. &#8220;Good
Heavens!&#8221; he thought. &#8220;What a genius! What a
soul! What a phrase!&#8221; Suddenly the door opened
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>and Agnes Carillon was ushered in. She hesitated a
second, and then recognised Rennes, who had his back
to the light. Her first instinct was to retreat; her
first feeling was a strange sensation of pleasure and
fear. His usually cold and wearied face took an
expression of controlled but unmistakable delight.
She blushed, though not with resentment, yet she
avoided, by appearing to have some difficulty with her
muff, his outstretched hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have called on your mother,&#8221; said she. &#8220;I
thought you would be on your way to Rome.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her lips were red and rather full: her cheeks were
pink, her throat and brows were white. Her
demeanour was, while modest, neither shy nor self-conscious.
David was struck by her height and the
extreme slightness of her figure. She wore a large
Gainsborough hat with long plumes, a black gown,
and a collar of old <i>point de Venise</i>. She had come up
from the country, and her presence brought its freshness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why are you in town?&#8221; he asked abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was bored at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the trousseau?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The trousseau?&#8221; she said, lifting her eyes for the
first time to his.</p>

<p>&#8220;They say it is unlucky to try on your wedding-dress,&#8221;
he continued, seeking relief in the very torture
of reminding himself that the date of her marriage
with Lord Reckage was fixed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I never think about luck,&#8221; she answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I met Reckage at the play last night. I lunched
with him to-day,&#8221; said Rennes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am so glad that you are friends. I want you to
like him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt he thinks me mad. Politicians always
regard artists as madmen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Beauclerk is considered very cultured. I
hate the word. He is interested in art.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No doubt&mdash;as a means of investment, an educational
influence, or a topic of conversation for light
moments.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are severe. Yet I like to hear you talk.&#8221;</p>

<p>She hoped that his talk would drown the singing in
her heart, the whispering in her ears, the footsteps of
doubt&mdash;doubt of herself, doubt of Reckage, coming
nearer and nearer. She had been taught everything.
She had discovered nothing. Love itself had come to her
in the shape of a cruel code of responsibilities. Lately
she had been dwelling with an almost feverish emphasis
on the question of duty. She had wearied Reckage;
she had exhausted herself by the tenacity of her mind
toward that dull subject. And the real truth about
much in life was forcing itself upon her. She was
essentially a woman of affairs. Her face absorbed the
poetry of her nature, just as a flower extracts every
excellence from its surrounding soil, and, shining out
for the sun, wastes no blossom underground. It had
been her earliest ambition to marry a Member of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>Parliament and help him&mdash;by her prayers and counsel&mdash;on
his conscientious career toward Downing Street.
She had received an austere education, and even her
native generosity of heart could not soften the indignation
she had been trained to feel against any neglect
of duty. Duty was a term which she applied to that
science of things generally expedient which tradition
has presented to us in the household proverbs and
maxims of every nation. Early rising, controlling
one's temper, paying one's debts, consideration for
others, working while it is day, taking stitches in time&mdash;all
these to that orthodox mind were matters of imperative
obligation, if not Divine command. David's
impulsive nature and self-indulgent habits filled her
with overwhelming sorrow and dismay. She could
not understand the rapid changes of mood, the disordered
views, the storm and violence which are
characteristic of every artist whose work is a form of
autobiography rather than a presentment of impersonal
forms and effects.</p>

<p>In Rennes there were two principles constantly at
work: the David who acted, and the David who
observed, criticised, and reproduced in allegorical guise,
the inspiring performance. Agnes knew nothing of
this common phenomenon in creative genius, and
when her friend refreshed his imagination by appearing
in a new <i>rôle</i>, she was as terrified as a child before
some clever trick in experimental chemistry. From
time to time he expressed opinions which startled her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>She begged him once to paint a &#8220;religious&#8221; picture.
He would not. A feeling that she had experienced
some bitter disappointment weighed upon her spirit.
Yet when she seemed to give that disappointment a
cause, she was careful to leave it in obscurity. She
would not permit herself to think, and, pale with
suffering, she would check the painful questions
which rose already answered. Her affection for
Rennes was one of those serious passions which
sometimes take root in an unsentimental nature, and
derive a strength from philosophy which romantic
considerations, pleasant as they are, can never bestow.
Romance will add a magical delight to the pleasures
of existence, but for the burden of the day one needs a
sobriety of thought which would ring singularly flat
in a love-lyric, which is certainly opposed to those
emotions which produce what is commonly regarded
as interesting behaviour. Agnes had not been drawn to
Rennes at first sight, but rather by degrees and against
her better judgment. She had found him unstable and
affected; on the other hand, she admired his fine figure,
his talent, his conversation, and the fire in his brilliant
eyes. She told herself that she was deeply anxious
about his soul, but, in a crowd, she watched for his
broad shoulders and his handsome face. Such was her
friendship, and she had known him for two years.
Her first season had been a startling success. She had
the misery of rejecting several suitors of whom her
father fully approved&mdash;one was an Archdeacon. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>had been drawn more than kindly toward a consumptive
violinist whom she had met at a Saturday entertainment
for the poor at Kensal Green. Not a single
word of love ever passed between them. He called
once or twice at her aunt's house in Chester Square,
and they had played together some of Corelli's sonatas.
Her aunt carried her away to Brighton, and no more
was heard of the young violinist till a rumour reached
them that he was drinking himself to death at St.
Moritz. Agnes said many prayers for him. At last
a second rumour reached her that the first was wholly
incorrect. He had married a very nice girl with a lot
of money and was building a villa at Cannes. Agnes
told herself that she was thankful to hear it. The
next year she became engaged to a young Member of
Parliament with really fine prospects. She was not in
love, but she liked him better than all her friends. She
felt serene, and at last useful. Then a story reached
her about another woman, and yet another woman
before that one. The story was true and not at all
pretty. The Bishop was obliged to support his
daughter in her refusal to regard matters in what
her betrothed described as a sane and reasonable
manner. He had sinned and he was sorry, and what
was more, he had every desire to reform. But Agnes
remained firm, although she had probably never been
so nearly in love with him as she was on the day when
she returned all his charming letters and the ring and
his photograph. It was a trying moment. She was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>ordered abroad, and she spent the winter at Rome,
where she read ancient history and visited churches
and excited a great deal of admiration. Mrs. Rennes
and David were also at Rome. The three met at
the house of an irreproachable Marchesa. They
became friends. Miss Carillon's aunt, who was a
maiden lady with means, succumbed to the fascinating
eloquence of an amateur <i>connoisseur</i> of antique gems.
In her new character of <i>fiancée</i>, she found it inconvenient
to chaperon a young niece. She joined a
widowed friend, and gladly assented to the suggestion
that dear Agnes should visit Mrs. Rennes in Paris.
The Bishop saw no impediment to the plan. He had
been at Oxford with the late Archibald Rennes, an
odd fellow but high-minded. Mrs. Rennes was the
daughter of a General Hughes-Drummond. Every
one knew the Hughes-Drummonds. They were
very good people indeed. The Bishop hoped that
Agnes would enjoy herself, give her kind friend as
little trouble as possible, and come home fully restored
in spirits. He forgot David. It may be that others
omitted to mention him. The Bishop was not pleased
when the rumour reached him that this artist was
included in the party. What were his habits? What
were his prospects? Were his artistic talents such
that he might reasonably hope to become a Royal
Academician and maintain an establishment? What
<i>class</i> of pictures did he paint? Were they lofty in
tone? Did they exalt and purify the mind? Would
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>they make good engravings&mdash;such engravings as one
might hang on one's walls? The correspondence
and the questions were endless. David spent a week
end at the Episcopal Palace, and behaved so well that
he became frightened at his own capabilities for John
Bullism. He was a little annoyed, too, to find himself
at ease in a British home circle. The Bishop
was, at all events, satisfied. Agnes was enchanted,
and, transfigured by unconscious passion, looked more
beautiful than ever. David enjoyed the services in
the cathedral; he liked the quiet Sunday afternoon,
he was impressed by Dr. Carillon's real earnestness in
the pulpit. The visit was a great success. Before he
left, he begged Agnes to write to him &#8220;when she
could spare the time.&#8221; The young man had tried
everything except a Platonic friendship with a lovely
girl. He fancied that he found in Agnes Carillon
that purity coupled with magnetism which makes
such experiments attractive. They corresponded
regularly, but they did not meet again for several
months. When he returned, a little tired of
platonism, letter-writing, intellectuality, and longing
a great deal for the sight of her face, he found her
engaged to Lord Reckage. So nature revenges itself.
He detected a certain triumph and also a certain deep
reproach in her gaze. She insisted that she was more
than happy, but something under these words seemed
to murmur&mdash;&#8220;You have spoilt our lives.&#8221; Her
manner, nevertheless, never altered. She was in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>variably
sympathetic, gracious, delicately emotional.
In letters she signed herself, &#8220;Yours affectionately,
Agnes Carillon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How I should like to paint you in this light!&#8221;
he said, all at once. &#8220;That is the dress I love best.
Don't wear it often.&#8221; The remark was slight enough
as a pretty speech within the bounds of flirtation, but
the tone in which he uttered it meant more, and the
girl's womanly instinct told her that the dangerous
limit in their &#8220;friendship&#8221; had been reached. He saw
her turn pale. She looked away from him, and
swallowed thoughts which were far more bitter than
any words she could have spoken.</p>

<p>&#8220;You never used to say these things,&#8221; she
exclaimed at last; &#8220;why do you say them
now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought them&mdash;always,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;But I
am a Pagan. I tried to keep my Paganism for others,
and what you would call &#8216;the best in me&#8217; for you.
You may be able to understand. Anyhow, I made a
mistake&mdash;a terrible mistake. It was a false position,
and I couldn't maintain it. Now I don't even want
to maintain it. Then it was a kind of vanity. I
mean that time when I was at the Palace. I had been
reading a lot of beautiful unreal stuff about the soul.
I thought I had reached a very high place. Of course
I had&mdash;because nothing is higher or purer than real
human love. But I wouldn't call it love. So I went
abroad, and wrote any amount of &#8216;literature&#8217; to you.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>And all the time Reckage was here&mdash;asking you,
wisely enough, to marry him. And you, wisely
enough, accepted him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Agnes sat still, with her eyes down, cold, silent,
forbidding. She did not understand him. She had
neither the knowledge of life, nor the imagination,
which could make such understanding possible. But
she saw in his look that he loved her, that he was
unhappy. She knew that Reckage had never shown
so much feeling. Yet had she not given her word to
Reckage? Was it not irrevocable? Was Rennes
behaving well in speaking out&mdash;too late? Was it too
late? A torrent of questions poured into her mind.
She dragged off her gloves, and spread out her hands,
which were slim and white, and stared at her sapphire
engagement ring.</p>

<p>&#8220;A weak man submits to destiny,&#8221; said Rennes,
&#8220;a strong one makes his own. It is what we think
of ourselves which determines our fate. If I regard
myself as a poor creature, I shall, no doubt, act the
part of a poor creature. But,&#8221; he added, with an
ironical smile, &#8220;it is never too late to give up one's
prejudices. I can't stand by and look on any longer.
I intend to leave England for some years. I hope we
may never meet again. Don't answer me, because
there is nothing for you to say. You have been
perfectly kind, perfectly charming, perfectly consistent.
You have never deceived me and you have never
deceived yourself.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>She interrupted him:</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope not. Oh, I hope I have never deceived
myself&mdash;or you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was grateful for your friendship,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I
can't be grateful for it now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Agnes drew a long breath and murmured random
words about the &#8220;time.&#8221; Was it getting late?</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Rennes, &#8220;too late. Did I ever tell
you why my father, with all his prospects, became a
drawing-master? He told me that he had suffered
so much learning why he could never paint, nor
hope to paint, that he was determined to devote his
knowledge to the service of apprentices. It seemed
to him such an awful thing to mistake one's vocation.
Now I feel that one of us&mdash;perhaps both of us, you
and I, are doing even a worse thing. We are deliberately
throwing happiness to the dogs.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't think so,&#8221; said Agnes, in a trembling
voice. &#8220;There is duty, you know; that is something
higher than happiness, I believe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you so sure?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I envy you. I don't even know what you mean
by duty. It seems to me another name for the
tyranny of false sentiment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't disturb my ideas,&#8221; she exclaimed, with an
appealing gesture. &#8220;Don't say these things. They
make me wretched. I can't afford to doubt and
question. One must have a few permanent rules of
conduct.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if they are fantastic, capricious, insincere?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can't argue. I am not clever. I will not
change my views. I dare not. It would make me
hate you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are the slave of convention.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be. That is safer, after all, than being
the slave of some other will stronger than my own.
Why do you try to disturb my life&mdash;now&mdash;after so
many really happy months of friendship?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were they so happy? Agnes, were they happy?&#8221;</p>

<p>She hesitated.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said, at last; &#8220;relatively, yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is quite true. Good women drive us to the
bad ones.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh! what can you mean? Surely we are saying
too much. We shall reproach ourselves later. I live,
again and again, through one conversation. The
phrases come into my mind with every possible shade
of significance.&#8221;</p>

<p>She pushed back her hat, and pressed her hand to her
brow, which was contracting nervously as she spoke.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't wish to be altered by any change in principle,&#8221;
she continued, &#8220;nor distracted, from my plain
obligations, into other interests. I daresay I sound
quite heartless and odd. I daresay you won't like
me any more.&#8221; Her voice faltered, but her lips
remained precise. &#8220;But one must know one's mind&mdash;one
<i>must</i>. You don't know yours; that is the
whole trouble, David.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>She had never called him by his Christian name
before, and now the forced sternness of her tone gave
it almost the accent of a farewell.</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps we have helped each other,&#8221; she went
on; &#8220;at all events, you have taught me how to look
at things. You are clever and original and all that.
I am rather commonplace, and I never have new or
surprising thoughts. The more I learn, the more
I grow attached to the ordinary ways. Once
you called me the ideal <i>bourgeoise</i>. You were
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not entirely,&#8221; said Rennes. &#8220;You think too
much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You taught me that. I never used to consider
people or notions. I accepted them without criticism.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The madness of criticism has entered into you,&#8221;
he said. &#8220;It is the worst, most destructive thing on
earth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How could I have accepted you&mdash;as my friend&mdash;without
it?&#8221; she asked. &#8220;You puzzled me. I tried
to understand you. No one had ever puzzled me
before. No one, you may be quite sure, will ever
puzzle me, in the same degree, again.&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave him a long, tearful glance, in which
defiance, reproach, determination, and a certain cruelty
shone like iron under water. He made a movement
toward her. The strength of his more emotional
nature might have made a final assault&mdash;not uselessly&mdash;on
her assumed &#8220;reasonableness.&#8221; No appeal, no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>threat could have moved her from the mental attitude
she had decided on&mdash;the duty of keeping her word to
Lord Reckage. But she might have been urged
to the more candid course of ascertaining how far
his lordship's true happiness was really involved in
the question. At that moment, however, Mrs.
Rennes came into the room. She gave a little cry
of surprise when she saw her son. Then she kissed
Agnes, and sat down, looking anxiously from one to
the other with something not unlike grief, not unlike
jealousy.</p>

<p>Her life and habits of thought were simple,
but she had been highly educated. She was an
accomplished linguist, a good musician, a most intelligent
companion. Things which she could not comprehend
she would, at least, accept on faith. There had
never been the shadow of a quarrel between David
and herself. But she felt, by intuition, that Agnes
Carillon had, in some way, affected his life, his work,
his whole nature. She could not blame her, because
she knew nothing definite about the understanding
which existed, plainly enough, between her son and
this young lady. She had a horror, however, of flirtation
and flirts. It seemed to her that, under all this
talk and correspondence on art, poetry, scenery, and
the like, there was a strong under-current of emotion.
So she smiled upon Agnes with a certain reserve, as
though she were not quite sure whether she had any
great reason to feel delighted at her call. At a glance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>from David, however, her look softened into real
friendliness.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was so surprised to see Mr. Rennes here,&#8221; said
Agnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am surprised, too,&#8221; said the older woman.</p>

<p>A restraint fell upon all three. David walked
about the room, looking for things he did not want,
and asking questions he did not wish answered,
although he hoped they would interest his mother.
But his spirits soon flagged. The conversation became
trivial and absurd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where are you staying?&#8221; asked Mrs. Rennes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am with Pensée Fitz Rewes,&#8221; said Agnes; &#8220;she
has gone in the carriage to do a little shopping. She
will send it here for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The carriage was at that instant announced.
David went down the stairs with Agnes and
handed her in. He said nothing. Mrs. Rennes
watched the pair from the window and nodded her
farewell with much gravity. When David returned
to her, he found her reading peacefully Trollope's last
novel. It was for these graces that he loved her most.
He scribbled letters at her writing-table for the next
hour. Then he spoke&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going,&#8221; said he, &#8220;to the East. I need a
change. I suppose it will mean six months.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how you will enjoy it!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what will you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I live from day to day, my dear. I am quite
contented.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This journey is not a mere caprice. I have been
contemplating it for some time,&#8221; he said.</p>

<p>Mrs. Rennes' hair was white and her long, equine
countenance, sallow. When her feelings were stirred,
she showed it only by a cloudy pallor which would
steal over her face as a kind of veil&mdash;separating her
from the rest of mortals.</p>

<p>&#8220;One has to get away from England,&#8221; continued
Rennes: &#8220;one has to get away from one's self.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And where is your self now?&#8221; she asked, not
venturing to look at him.</p>

<p>&#8220;With that girl,&#8221; he answered, suddenly; &#8220;with
that girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you love her?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know. I suppose I do. Oh! I would
love her if I could ever be absolutely sincere. But this
I do know&mdash;I can't see her married to that fellow
Reckage. So I must go away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid she is a coquette&mdash;a serious coquette,
my dear boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is nothing of the kind. She is a true woman.
Don't talk about her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a>CHAPTER VIII</h2>


<p>Sara had spent the morning crying bitterly, in bed.
Her letter to the Duke of Marshire was on the table
by her side. From time to time she had taken it up,
turned it over, shed fresh tears, and reproached herself
for indecision. She held at bay every thought of
Robert Orange, and formed the resolve of banishing
him from her mind for ever. When the time came
to dress for luncheon, she brightened a little, for the
prospect of disguising her true feelings in the presence
of Lord Reckage and Pensée appealed to that genius
for mischief which animated the whole current of her
life. <i>To baffle the looker-on</i> seemed not merely a great
science, but the one game of wits which could never
lose its interest. She was not insincere. She thought
that lies, as a rule, were clumsy shifts, and abominable.
Even in the moments when she was most thoroughly
conscious of her talent for misleading others, she had
never brought herself to think well of deception. She
would have liked to feel that her heart was an open
book for her friends to read. It would have been
pleasant, she believed, if all could have known always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>that she practised a delicate art and played, consummately,
fine comedy whenever she found spectators.
But a solitary, mismanaged childhood, and the
constant sense of being in many ways a foreigner,
had taught her the penalty of frankness where
sympathy could not supply, from its own knowledge,
the unutterable half which makes up every confidence.
The bitter pleasures of a conscience which
caresses its worst burden were the only real ones of
her daily existence. When she could say, at the end
of the day, &#8220;I have fooled them all: they think I am
happy, I am not: they think Reckage amuses me,
he doesn't. They think I delight in these dull dinners
and balls, I hate them,&#8221; a sort of exultation&mdash;the
pride of a spirit singing under torture&mdash;would fill her
whole being. All youth that is strong and thoughtful
has much of this instinct of dissimulation. The
world&mdash;to a young mind&mdash;appears controlled by
elderly, suspicious, hateful custodians ever on the
alert to capture, or thwart, every high enterprise and
every passionate desire. There seems a vast conspiracy
against happiness&mdash;the withered, dreary wiseacres
in opposition to the joy, the daring, the beauty,
the reckless vitality of souls still under the spell of
spring. When poor Sara could escape from town into
the country, mount her horse, and tear through a
storm, the neighbours compared her to a witch on
a broomstick, and, shaking their heads, would foresee
much sipping of sorrow by the spoonful in the future
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>of Lord Garrow. To-day, however, the young lady
assumed her most demure expression, and received the
guests at luncheon as though she had never learnt
the meaning of tears nor joined the gale in spirit.</p>

<p>Sir Piers Harding was the last to arrive. He was
a thick-set, livid man with an unyielding smile and
the yellow eyes of one whom rich diet rather than
an angry god had rendered melancholy.</p>

<p>&#8220;You haven't changed in the least,&#8221; he said,
considering Lord Garrow with some resentment.</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, well!&#8221; replied his lordship, &#8220;eleven years do
not make much difference at my time of life. You,
however, are decidedly greyer. Where have you been
hiding yourself? I think you were foolish to leave
England. Gladstone was remarking but the other
day, &#8216;Harding was always so cocksure.&#8217; &#8216;And
wasn't he right?&#8217; said I. &#8216;Of course,&#8217; said he; &#8216;and
that was the worst of him. He <i>was</i> right. Who
could stand it?&#8217; That's the world. It's devilish
unappreciative of the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reckage, much bored by the old men, stood by
Pensée's chair, where he could watch Sara and angle
for her glance. When it happened that she smiled at
him a little&mdash;either in mere friendship or mockery&mdash;he
felt a kind of fire steal through his veins, and he
told himself that she was a dangerous woman&mdash;a
woman who could get her own way in the long run.
That she was a girl&mdash;and, with all her shortcomings,
a very innocent one&mdash;made her odd powers of fascina<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>tion
but the more insidious. She wore a dress of
wine-coloured silk which fitted plainly over her breast
and shoulders and fell in graceful flounces from the
waist. The warm, olive lines of her cheek and
throat appeared the darker in contrast with a twist
of white lace which she wore round her neck; and
her black hair, dressed higher than usual, was held
in place by a large ruby comb which caught the fire-light
as she moved. Reckage was conscious, for the
first time in his life, of a real embarrassment. He
could not talk to her; he felt tongue-tied when she
addressed him. Ill at ease, yet not unhappy, he
struggled to maintain some coherence in his conversation;
but, at each moment, his own ideas grew less
certain and Sara's voice more enchanting. It seemed
to convey the lulling powers of an anodyne. When
he tried to rouse himself, the effort was as painful as
the attempt to wake from a dream within a dream.</p>

<p>&#8220;You were at the wedding this morning?&#8221; she
asked lightly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No.... What a fool I am! Yes, of course.
You mean Robert's wedding?&#8221;</p>

<p>She gave a little smile, and murmured, dropping
her voice, &#8220;I meant Robert's wedding.&#8221;</p>

<p>Luncheon was then announced: the sliding doors
which separated the dining-room from Lord Garrow's
library were rolled back. They all walked in&mdash;Pensée
and Sara leading the way.</p>

<p>&#8220;A sweet creature!&#8221; whispered his lordship behind
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>their backs, indicating Lady Fitz Rewes. He sighed
as he spoke. He could never feel that there was not
something deplorable in Sara's physical brilliancy.
Her upper-lip that day had a certain curl which he
had learnt to regard as a danger-signal. What would
she do next? As he sat down at the table and
observed the sweep of her eyelashes toward Reckage,
a presentiment of trouble clouded the new hopes he
had formed for her career.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who are your strong men now?&#8221; asked Harding
suddenly, after a moment's contemplation of Reckage,
who sat opposite.</p>

<p>&#8220;Our strong men?&#8221; faltered Lord Garrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Aren't most of 'em place-hunters and self-seekers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must meet Robert Orange,&#8221; said Pensée;
&#8220;Mr. Disraeli believes in Robert Orange.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I never heard of him,&#8221; observed Sir Piers. &#8220;Who
is he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may well ask,&#8221; said Lord Garrow. &#8220;He
claims to be a de Hausée&mdash;on his father's side.
Reckage can tell you about him. Many have a high
opinion of the fellow, and say that if he will stick to
one branch of politics, he may become useful. Personally,
I don't call him a man of the world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not of our world, perhaps, papa. But there are
so many other worlds!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sara likes him. A lot of women like him,&#8221; said
his lordship. He was annoyed at her interruption
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>and took his revenge by a feminine thrust. &#8220;The
hero,&#8221; said he, &#8220;married some mysterious person this
very morning. We may not hear so much about him
in the future!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Lord Garrow,&#8221; said Pensée, &#8220;his wife is
a friend of mine&mdash;she is the most charming person.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sara put out her hand and touched Reckage on the
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;that the wife will
be an obstacle in his way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who can tell? Of course she has means, and he
likes to do everything well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Speaking for myself,&#8221; said Harding, &#8220;I have
always held that a man's career rests rather on his
genius than his marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you, my dear fellow,&#8221; put in Lord Garrow,
testily, &#8220;you retired from political life because your
theories could find no illustration there.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pardon me,&#8221; said Sir Piers, with a grim laugh.
&#8220;I retired because I had a faultless wife but unfortunately
no genius. I shall therefore watch your
friend's triumph or failure&mdash;for his position would
seem to be precisely the reverse of my own&mdash;with
peculiar sympathy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah! I fear you are rather heartless,&#8221; exclaimed
Sara. &#8220;For a man to have gone so far as Orange,
and to know that perhaps&mdash;I say, perhaps&mdash;he can
hope no higher because he made a fool of himself
about a woman!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You speak as though it were a romantic marriage&mdash;a
question of love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said the young lady softly. &#8220;It is a
great passion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, after all,&#8221; observed Harding, who was not
insensible himself to Sara's delightfulness, &#8220;the British
public is absurdly fond of a love-match. They adore
a sentimental Prime Minister. They want to see
him either marrying for love, or jilted in his youth for
a richer man. These things enlist the popular sympathy.
What made Henry Fox? His elopement with Lady
Caroline Lennox.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure,&#8221; said Reckage&mdash;&#8220;to be sure. That's
a point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a compliment to the sex,&#8221; continued Harding,
&#8220;when a great man is taken captive by a pretty face.
Men, too, rally round a Lochinvar. Such an evidence
of heart&mdash;or folly, if you prefer to call it so&mdash;is also
an evidence of disinterestedness. So, on the whole,
I cannot follow your objections to the new Mrs.
Orange.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have been away so long,&#8221; said Garrow fussily,
&#8220;that you have forgotten our prejudices. Orange
himself, to begin with, has something mysterious in
his origin. They say he is French&mdash;related to the
old French aristocracy; but the less one says in
England about foreign pedigrees the better. All
that of itself is against him, and Mrs. Orange, it
seems, is more or less French, or Austrian, too. We
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>can't help regarding them as foreigners, and I always
distrust foreigners in politics. Why should they care
for England? I ask myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, indeed?&#8221; said Harding, with irony.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have I made myself clearer?&#8221; asked Garrow.
&#8220;I can afford to speak. My own wife was a Russian.
But I was not in political life, and she was an
Ambassador's daughter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You think you would feel more sure of Orange's
patriotic instinct if he had chosen an Englishwoman?&#8221;
said Reckage.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am bound to say that he would have shown discretion
in settling down with one of our simple-hearted
Saxon girls.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who was Mrs. Orange before she married
Orange?&#8221; asked Harding.</p>

<p>&#8220;A widow&mdash;a Mrs. Parflete,&#8221; said Garrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Parflete!&#8221; exclaimed Harding. &#8220;Mrs. Parflete!
But I have met her. She married Wrexham Parflete,
an extraordinary creature. He lived for years with
the Archduke Charles of Alberia. People used to say
that Mrs. Parflete was the Archduke's daughter. I
ran across Parflete the other day in Sicily.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he is dead,&#8221; said Pensée, much agitated; &#8220;he
drowned himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot help that,&#8221; repeated Sir Piers. &#8220;I met
him last week, and he beat me at écarté.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it is not the same man,&#8221; said Reckage, &#8220;quite
obviously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wrexham Parflete had a wife; I heard her sing
at a dinner-party in Madrid. She was living with the
Countess Des Escas; there was a row and a duel on
her account. I never forget names or faces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this looks serious,&#8221; said Reckage. &#8220;Do you
quite understand? It's the sort of thing one hardly
dares to think. That is to say if you mean what I
mean. The marriage can't be legal.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two women turned pale and looked away from
each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;I mean as much or as little as you like,&#8221; said
Harding. &#8220;But Parflete was alive last Monday.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But bigamy is so vulgar,&#8221; observed Lord Garrow.
&#8220;You must be mistaken. It is too dreadful!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dreadful, indeed! And a great piece of folly
into the bargain. It is selling the bear's skin before
you have killed the bear.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Fitz Rewes glanced piteously at the three men
and wrung her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't you see,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;don't you see
that if there is the least doubt of Mr. Parflete's death,
we ought to go to them. Some one must follow them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is that touch of the absurd about it,&#8221; said
Reckage, &#8220;which makes it difficult for a friend to
come forward. To pursue a man on his wedding
journey&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is no laughing matter,&#8221; put in Lord Garrow;
&#8220;and if the woman has deceived the poor fellow, it's
a monstrous crime.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, she hasn't; she couldn't deceive him,&#8221; said
Pensée. &#8220;I know her intimately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She was considered very clever&mdash;at Madrid,&#8221; said
Sir Piers, finely. &#8220;To you she may appear more to
be pitied than she really is.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't say such things! I won't hear them. I
love her very much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps she is clever enough to appear stupid in
public.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no!&#8221; Her voice trembled and tears gushed
from her eyes. &#8220;You will regret these words. This
news will kill her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Something must be done,&#8221; said Sara. &#8220;Beauclerk,
you ought to follow them and tell them. Pensée
is right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This will make a horrid scandal,&#8221; said Lord
Garrow, who was appalled at the prospect of being
mixed up in so disagreeable an affair. &#8220;Why not leave
it alone? It is not our business.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is Beauclerk's business, papa. Just put
yourself in his place. Surely that is not asking too
much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must avoid everything precipitate,&#8221; said
Reckage; &#8220;we mustn't be over-hasty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Fitz Rewes wiped her eyes, rose from the
table, and began to draw on her gloves.</p>

<p>&#8220;But we must be friends,&#8221; she said; &#8220;if you cannot
go to them, I will. Do you realise the poor child's
position? An illegal marriage! She is the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>gentle, beautiful person I ever saw, with the best head,
the purest heart. She professes <i>nothing</i>. I judge her
by her actions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you must see,&#8221; said Reckage, &#8220;that I can't
give Orange all this pain unless I have something more
definite to go on. Sir Piers tells us that he played
cards with Wrexham Parflete last week.&#8221; He
paused.</p>

<p>&#8220;Wait a moment,&#8221; said Harding; &#8220;wait a moment.
Does any one present know Parflete's handwriting?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do,&#8221; said Pensée. &#8220;I saw his last letter to his
wife. He wrote it before he committed suicide.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sir Piers took out his pocket-book, and, from the
several papers it contained, selected a three-cornered
note.</p>

<p>&#8220;By the merest chance,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I have this
with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The others unconsciously left their seats and looked
over his shoulder while he smoothed out the sheet.
It was dated plainly, &#8220;October 7, 1869,&#8221; and contained
the acknowledgment of two £10 notes won
at écarté.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the hand,&#8221; said Pensée. &#8220;One could not
mistake it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then this is really very serious,&#8221; said Lord
Reckage, with twitching lips. &#8220;The whole story has
had all along something of unreality about it. Robert
seems fated to a renunciant career&mdash;colourless, self-annihilating.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will you do?&#8221; murmured Pensée, with an
imploring gesture. &#8220;What will you do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They leave Southampton at three o'clock,&#8221; said
Reckage; &#8220;it is now half-past two. The steamer
goes twice a week only. I can send him a telegram
and follow them overland&mdash;by way of Calais.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I must go also,&#8221; said Pensée firmly. &#8220;She
will need me. I have had a presentiment of trouble
so long that now I feel &#8216;Here it is come at last.&#8217; I
cannot be too thankful to God that it isn't worse.&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing showed under the innavigable depths of
Sara's eyes. She had moved to the fireplace and stood
there holding one small foot to the blaze.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you cold?&#8221; asked her father anxiously.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am ice,&#8221; she said, &#8220;ice!&#8221;</p>

<p>Reckage joined her and said, under his voice, &#8220;You
think I ought to go, don't you?&#8221;</p>

<p>This question&mdash;given in a half-whisper&mdash;seemed to
establish a fresh intimacy between them. It was the
renewal of their old friendship on deeper terms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you must go,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;and, Beauclerk,
write to me and tell me how he bears it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is accustomed to a repressive discipline on
these matters. The philosophic mind, you know, is
never quite in health. Probably, he won't show much
feeling.&#8221;</p>

<p>His gaze seemed to burn into her face. It was as
though she had been walking in an arbour and
suddenly, through some rift in the boughs, found
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>herself exposed to the scorching sun. She felt
dominated by a force stronger than her own nature.
A little afraid, she shrank instinctively away from him,
and as she dared not look up, she did not see the
expression of triumph, mingled with other things,
which, for a moment, lit up Lord Reckage's ordinarily
inscrutable countenance. Lately, he had been somewhat
depressed by his encounter with refractory wills.
His horse, his colleagues on the Bond of Association,
his future bride, had showed themselves fatiguing,
perhaps worthless, certainly disheartening and independent
accessories to his life. Here, at last, was
some one brilliant, stimulating, by no means self-seeking,
Quixotic in enthusiasms.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sara,&#8221; he said, obeying an impulse which surprised
himself, &#8220;do you believe in me?&#8221;</p>

<p>This time she gave him a straight glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;You might do a great
deal if you could forget yourself for a few months.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pensée, much troubled and full of thoughts, walked
over to them.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Sara!&#8221; she said, &#8220;isn't it terrible? If you
could have seen them both this morning&mdash;she looked
so beautiful, perfectly lovely&mdash;a sight I never can
forget. And now this blow! What man can teach
men to understand the will of God?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a>CHAPTER IX</h2>


<p>Robert and Brigit were silent with happiness on their
way to Southampton. Side by side they watched the
country through the carriage windows. There had
been a fog in London when they left, and the sun,
at intervals, shone out like a live coal among dying
embers. All was obscured; the foot-passengers and
passing vehicles seemed black straying shadows in the
atmosphere. But the express emerged at last from
the clinging darkness into autumnal fields, some brown
after the harvest, others studded with hay-ricks. At
one point in the landscape they noticed a flock of
sheep drinking at a stream. The boy who guarded
them waved his cap at the train, and this little signal,
coming, as it were, from human nature, gave them a
reassurance of the day's reality. Near Bishopstoke the
clouds were white and dense, but, rippling in places,
they disclosed blue stretches of the heaven which, in
their masses, they concealed. Southampton began
with small houses. One had a tattered garden, where
a stone copy of the Medicean Venus stood on a patch
of squalid turf near a clothes' line and against an ivy-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>grown
wall. Then the green sands were reached.
The sea, like liquid granite, sparkled in the distance.
Rows of dull dwellings, shops, public-houses, and hotels
came next. The train, with a shriek, rushed into the
station. It was still too early for lunch, so they walked
down to the pier, where they saw several yachts and
pleasure-boats at anchor in the harbour, and the New
Forest greenly outlined in the distance. These were
the things which engraved themselves on Brigit's
mind. The impressibility of youth is retentive for
outward objects, but the inner mood&mdash;the sensation
and idea which make the mental state&mdash;lives unconsciously,
and is recognised only in the long process of
time. Brigit could have described the scene, but her
emotions did not seem to her, emotions. Absorbed by
them, and in them, she neither abandoned herself to
the hour nor asked herself what the hour held. She
and the hour were one&mdash;a single note; and the joy
she felt at being with Robert, leaning on his arm and
hearing his voice, was so simple that, even if a psychologist
of the deepest experience had been able to
probe into the workings of her mind, he would have
found nothing there to analyse. Hers was a child's
affection&mdash;the first love of a heart still immature, and
not yet made suspicious of itself by contact with
others less innocent. Parflete had been too worldly-wise
not to guard and value&mdash;at its true price&mdash;a
disposition so graceful in its very essence. She had a
knowledge of affairs beyond her years, yet her own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>instincts, her education, her few friendships, had kept
her curiously ignorant of evil, of much also that is
neither good nor evil, but merely human. The sombre
sentimentality which lurks in most young girls of
seventeen was not in her character at all, and in its
stead she possessed the gaiety and carelessness of feeling
which belongs to imaginative rather than to sensuous
natures. A boy-like spirit showed itself in all her
words, movements, moods; her womanhood still
slept, and thus, while her intelligence made her an
unusual companion and her beauty presented a constant
appeal to all that is romantic, it was inevitable
that melancholy and reserve should enter largely into
the passionate love which Robert felt for her. He
told himself that he would not have her different.
The glance of her eyes, which stirred him strangely
to the very depths of his being, never varied in its
sweetness nor its calm. When her lightest touch
could sway his body and spirit, she, unconscious of
her power, would press his hand against her cheek and
talk about the geraniums in the convent garden or the
chances of the Carlist war. It was all wonderful. It
had seemed perfect. And yet&mdash;and yet. She was
not cold, but was she unearthly? Was she, perhaps,
some straying angel&mdash;some fervid, bright spirit, flame-coloured
and intangible, a being of the elfin race?
As they stood together looking at the distant coastline
a depression which he could neither fathom nor
control came over him. His bride seemed so much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>younger than he had ever realised. She cared for him&mdash;how
could he doubt it? But was the indefinable,
indispensable feeling absent?</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you remember our journey from Catesby?&#8221;
she asked suddenly. &#8220;I slept. Wasn't I dull? Did
you mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>No one could see them. He stooped and kissed
her fragrant, animated face. &#8220;I wish,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I
wish that you were not quite such a child.&#8221;</p>

<p>The feeling of solitariness weighed upon his soul
with a crushing weight unknown until that day&mdash;the
day of days, his wedding day. Heretofore he had
craved for solitude because it had been full of her
imagined companionship. Now that she actually
lived and talked by his side, the fancied image of her
paled, vanished. The real creature was adorable, but,
for some reason, maddening, and not, at all events,
the being of his fancy. Their old relations&mdash;ethereal
and exquisite, no doubt&mdash;now seemed an empty
mockery, self-deluding foolishness. He coloured at
the remembrance of all that Disraeli had hinted, and
Reckage had brutally declared, on the large topic of
idealism in passion. A man, in spite of all determinations
to be uncomplaining, knows the How much and
How little that he may demand, merely as a man, from
any given advantage or disadvantage in existence.
Robert, hating himself, condemning himself, was conscious,
in spite of himself, that Brigit's affection for
him was not love in the full human sense of the word.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>He had exchanged an ordinary self-restraint for an
impossibly false position. She could inspire his life,
but could she enter into it, be it, live it with him
daily? Would there not have to be great reservations,
half statements, and, worst of all, a subtle kind of
hypocrisy? He reproached himself for selfishness, yet
the fear came and it remained. He had captured the
rainbow and married the goddess. Were there not
many legends illustrating this folly?&mdash;stories of men
who had married divinities and perished, not because
the divinities were at fault, but because mortals must
wed with mortals. The sight of his wife's beauty
caused a sudden, violent irritation. He wished she
had none, for then, perhaps, he thought he would have
been satisfied, more than content, in the placid consideration
of her charms of character. He found
himself reduced to the absurd predicament of deciding
to banish her from his thoughts&mdash;a last sophism which
showed him, all too clearly, how wretched he was.
Their silence, which had been due in the first instance
to the sufficient delight of being in each other's company,
became that long pause which arises from an
unutterable embarrassment. Brigit felt by instinct
some change in Robert's mood, but as she could not
account for it then, her sympathy failed. The keen
salt air filled her with its own free buoyancy; her
delicate skin flushed in the wind; she forgot the
nervous strain of the morning, the awfulness of the
grey chapel, the new state of things, griefs that were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>past, responsibilities that were to come. She turned
to Orange as a child would turn to its inseparable
comrade, and clapped her hands with amusement at
an organ-grinder with a monkey and a dog whom
she noticed sitting at the end of the pier, waiting,
apparently, for one of the excursion steamers bound
for the Isle of Wight.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pennies for the monkey, Robert,&#8221; she cried; &#8220;a
lot of pennies! And then we must have our lunch.
May I have some chicken and one of those very droll,
very stupid, English rice puddings? Please let me
have one.... And may I kiss the dog? It is a
nice little dog&mdash;quite as nice as Pensée's Fidelio.
Now I am going to talk to the monkey.&#8221;</p>

<p>She ran toward the little animal, who was shivering,
pathetic and grotesque, in a military cap and red
petticoat trimmed with yellow braid. The dog, which
was a young pug with excellent points, gave Brigit,
after many entreaties, his paw. She addressed the
monkey in Italian, and laughed till she cried at its
absurdities. Robert looked on, consumed by a sensation
which he recognised, with much shame, as jealousy.
He thought the pug dull and the monkey revolting.
Yet she kissed one, and showered heavenly smiles on
both.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not know that you were so fond of animals,&#8221;
he said, as they walked to the hotel for lunch.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not,&#8221; she answered frankly, &#8220;as a rule.
But when I am with you I feel so happy that I want
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>to kiss everything&mdash;the ground, and the trees, and
chairs, and poodle dogs, and the whole world!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why not&mdash;me?&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked at him, blushed a little, and waited some
moments before she replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know,&#8221; she said at last. &#8220;It must be
because I am not in the habit of doing so. I am not
accustomed to you yet. I keep thinking &#8216;I shall wake
up in a minute and he will be miles away.&#8217; Can't
you understand? So I am pretending to myself all
the time that you are not really here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dearest, you don't quite understand; and you
are a little disappointed in me because I seem&mdash;I must
seem&mdash;rather flippant. I daren't be serious&mdash;I daren't.
I daren't believe that I am your wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>She shook her head, and her whole face became
clouded by the old, terrible, unnatural sadness which
he knew so much better than her laughter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not used to joy,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Perhaps, if we
ever get to Heaven, our first impulse will be to run
back again to Purgatory, where we are more at home!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have too much wit, darling, to be happy
anywhere!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! no! I don't ask to be conventionally happy,
but I want you always. That is all ... you, always,
on any terms&mdash;on a rag-heap, in a storm, with jackals
howling at us!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a picture!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My idea of unalloyed bliss, or, at least, the only
one I have ever permitted myself. I can even believe
that might be realised.&#8221; A smile hovered again about
her lips, but she looked steadily ahead, as though she
were still resolved not to reassure herself, by any too-frequent
glances, of his much-loved presence.</p>

<p>The peculiar tenderness of her voice was in itself a
charm against ill-humour. A rush of bitter self-reproach
told Robert that his dissatisfaction had been
the inevitable result of too many blessings on a base
nature. He tried to speak; he watched instead, with
a desperate, eager gaze, the play of her expressive
features.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; she said, &#8220;what our life is to be?
Not that I wish to pry into the future, but, for some
reason, I can never feel settled. Every morning is a
surprise. I think, too, about your character ... your
career. Have I helped you, or have I been
a hindrance? I am perverse, capricious&mdash;not an
angel. No human influence can help me very much.
I must depend on the discipline of God. Oh, if I
could know all that He wants me to do!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Most of us have that desire, Brigit. At least it
is better to be damned, in the world's opinion, trying
to do the will of God than saved&mdash;doing nothing!
One has to take a good many chances&mdash;even the
chance of displeasing Him&mdash;if it comes to a crisis.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many people would call that reckless.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let them call it anything,&#8221; said the young man;
&#8220;names do not matter. The ghastly, unspeakable
dread is to be timorous, halting, the creature of
indecision.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We are too much alike,&#8221; she sighed. &#8220;Oh,
Robert, if we did not suffer horribly within ourselves
when we do wrong, I believe we should both defy
every law in the world! I am a born rebel.&#8221;</p>

<p>More than a note of her mother's insolence was
in the speech, but the whole spirit of the dead actress
seemed to possess Brigit for that moment. Her being
rippled, as it were, with the new disturbance, just as
a pond will tremble to its edges at the mere dip of
a swallow's wing. The artistic hatred of all restraint
and the wild desire of liberty were the imperious
passions of her heart&mdash;more vehement than any other
feeling&mdash;even her love for Orange.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could fight,&#8221; she said, &#8220;a visible devil, but this
struggle with moods and tastes is deadening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What are the moods and tastes?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot describe them well. But music calls
me; I hear it trilling, and sobbing, and whispering
everywhere; and sometimes it is so loud and so
beautiful that I wonder why every one else doesn't
stop to listen. They never do. So I sing back my
answer. It is silent singing. You would only
wonder why I was so quiet all at once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have heard you sing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not with my real voice, Robert. It is stronger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>than it used to be.&#8221; She checked herself and hesitated,
stopped by a sudden scruple&mdash;a sort of delicacy. She
thought nothing at all of her beauty and never of her
fortune; but in giving Robert her voice, and the
nameless ambitions which enveloped it, she was
conscious that she had made, in some way, a
renunciation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say what you were going to say, dearest?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot forget,&#8221; she exclaimed desperately, &#8220;that
mama was an actress. And I remember some of the
nights at the theatre.... I liked the theatre....
I believe I could act.... I have learned the whole
of <i>Phédre</i> and the whole of <i>Juliet</i>. That is why I live.&#8221;</p>

<p>This avowal of her secret over-ruling instinct set
free the sanguine strength which circumstances had
imprisoned, but could not destroy, in her character.
The constant effort of hiding from all observation the
irrepressible yearnings of a talent that would not be
denied, had given her that quality of mysteriousness,
of dreamy habits of thought, of languor, which, even
to Robert, had looked as though she might find this
earth too rough to live on. But the despair which
comes from fighting, unsuccessfully, the world, is not
that appearance of weakness which is the result of
fighting&mdash;more or less effectively&mdash;one's own energy.
In this latter issue the beaten foe joins forces obediently
enough with the conqueror, till at last the opposing
elements are directed, whether for good or evil, by one
will.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;So you want to go on the stage,&#8221; said Orange
quietly.</p>

<p>She turned to him and saw, with anguish, the deep
amazement his words had not expressed.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, &#8220;no. I have you instead. I
want to devote myself to you&mdash;to exist for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don't you see, my dear child, that this is a
kind of&mdash;of pity&mdash;of anything you like, except the
one thing&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;I adore you, Robert. Oh, I can't get at what
I want to say! Any talk about love always sounds
very stilted or hollow. I only know that I want to
live intensely in all that concerns you; that just to
think of you makes me perfectly happy. When I
said that learning <i>Phédre</i> and <i>Juliet</i> was the reason
I lived, I was thinking of the time when I had no
right to think of you. Of course I loved you always,
from the beginning. It began at Chambord when
I first met you. I very seldom say these things, and
it is better that they should remain unsaid for the most
part. But you must never doubt me, and I feel to-day,
in spite of all we know about each other and all
we have suffered, that you are doubting me now.
You fear I don't know my own mind. Isn't this the
trouble?&#8221;</p>

<p>The intuition which comes to men and women
through suffering has always the certain sharpness of
a surgeon's knife. It may be a reassurance to have
the inmost thought plucked at by some loving spirit,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>and yet it is seldom that the touch can be given
without inflicting agony. Orange could not reply
at once. In his resolve to be unselfish&mdash;to put aside
that personal equation which was nothing less than
his whole nature&mdash;he had to steel his heart to her,
contradicting painfully, by curt, unfelt phrases, the
promptings of a soul turned in upon itself, desolate
and confused.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been selfish and thoughtless,&#8221; he said
abruptly; &#8220;a missed vocation is irreplaceable and it
is also indestructible. You hear the echo of the call
as long as you live&mdash;perhaps afterwards. At your age
you could feel, but you could not wholly understand
your talents. If you had told me all this before&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>She laughed with real joyousness and clung more
closely to his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn't tell you,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;because you
would have said just what you are saying now. You
are the one. All the rest is a means of forgetting
you. It is something resembling happiness to be
alone in the turmoil of the world with one unspoilt
illusion. This illusion in my case is a little idea that
I could be a great actress&mdash;perhaps! Don't look
grave, Robert. It makes you sad when I talk this
way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Those who can be disillusioned have no convictions.
Disillusion is the failure of a half-belief. I
learnt that long ago. But I hate the very word
in your mouth. Woe to us both if we cannot be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>resolute now. I could have waited&mdash;had I seen any
reason to wait. Time could make no difference in
my love. As it is, I have stolen you from yourself.
But now I have stolen you I will keep you. I cannot&mdash;cannot
give you back again to anything or anybody.&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke with that almost mocking tenderness
which dissembles its passion. At the practical difficulty
which now confronted him, all that was merely
romantic and speculative in his soul took flight, as
birds that are frightened from a quiet orchard by the
yelp of dogs. He became aware that he was bitterly
independent of the joys he had once found in the mere
spectacle of the exterior world&mdash;the play of light and
shade, the changing visions of the sky, the charm of
the earth. His own thoughts were now the sole
realities, and the dulness which suddenly came over
his vision for outward things seemed to render it the
more acute and concentrated for the things of the
mind. As distant hills and tree tops show most
distinctly before a storm, so every possibility which
can arise from a conflict of duties stood out with a
decisive clearness for his consideration. He had
married in haste a child-bride. There was no
blinking the fact. She had the strenuous religious
fibre, and with it real Bohemian blood. She was
also at the yielding age, when a dominant influence
could do much to divert or modify
every natural trait. He could not doubt that he
had this power over her then. How far, and to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>what purpose, should he exert it? For himself he
wished to discourage any hankering on her part for
public life, and, most of all, public life behind the
footlights, under an artificial sky. No one knew
better than he that there are certain things of love,
of nobility, of temperament, of pride, in certain lives
which the world at large would rather calumniate
than comprehend. People in general clung to their
opinions not because they were true, but because they
were their own, and among pretty general opinions&mdash;particularly
in the year 1869&mdash;there was a strong
prejudice against handsome young women who went
on the stage. It was not in him to consider&mdash;even as
an egoistic reflection to be put aside&mdash;how far Brigit's
project, carried into action, could effect his own
political career. His apprehensions were all for her
and her own content.</p>

<p>&#8220;Promise me,&#8221; he said, &#8220;that you will always tell
me when the acting mood comes over you. Never
fight it, never try to resist it, give it the liberty to
die, but also the right to live. There is an old Hindoo
proverb: &#8216;Find the flower which can bloom in the
silence that follows&mdash;not that which precedes&mdash;the
storm.&#8217; This applies perfectly to a talent or a vocation.
If the mood is there, in spite of fatigue, or discouragement,
or other claims&mdash;happiness for that matter&mdash;you
may depend that it is the ruling motive of your life
and not to be vanquished. You must follow the bent
or you will suffer&mdash;suffer till you die of it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How? in what way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Either in your vanity or your conscience; either
by the world's judgment on your conduct or by your
own estimate of your conduct. You have no vanity,
so the world doesn't count. But you have a conscience,
and that counts for all!&#8221;</p>

<p>He had not calculated, and he could not have foreseen,
the effect of his words. Her eyes filled with
tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dearest,&#8221; she said, &#8220;don't you see how trivial
everything is to me in comparison with you? But
I dare not love you so much as I can! So I encourage
other enthusiasms&mdash;out of fear. Sometimes it seems
as though the extraordinary, impossible ideal would be
to have you with me for ever, and be an actress as
well. But that is out of the question. And if I had
my choice&mdash;if I could be as great as Rachel or Mrs.
Siddons, or live with you on my dear rag-heap, with
the jackals howling&mdash;do you think that I would hesitate,
that I could hesitate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I believed you I should be a dreadful coxcomb!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Risk the coxcomb,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I can!&#8221;</p>

<p>A clanging bell and the noise of traffic on the quay
recalled them to the moment. They had barely time
to reach the steamer and get on board. A strong,
cold breeze was blowing; the sun shone full on the
sea, which, near the horizon, was as green as the sky
on a summer evening. But clouds were gathering in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>the north-west, and the peculiar brightness which
presages rain lent a fugitive brilliancy to the atmosphere.
The town and its spires glittered; the water,
frothing round the paddle-wheels, sent its shining
spray upon the brown boards of the wharf. Brigit
kissed her hands toward France.</p>

<p>&#8220;Soon,&#8221; she exclaimed, &#8220;soon I can kiss its ground.
How I love my country and the place where you
lived, Robert, as a boy!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X</h2>


<p>Lady Fitz Rewes had determined to prevent the
marriage of Lord Reckage with Agnes Carillon. She
could not forget the dreadful scene with Sara when that
poor girl was endeavouring to reconcile herself to the
Duke of Marshire's proposal. Pensée had studied
each person concerned in the possible tragedy. She
saw that Agnes was by no means serene, that the
portrait by Rennes somehow made no progress, that
Reckage was feverish and excitable. His bearing toward
Sara during the lunch confirmed Pensée's suspicion
that the love which had existed between them as boy
and girl was still unextinguished on either side. He
would have been less than mortal, she thought, if he
had not felt, with all the bitterness of a conscious
fool, that he had missed his true destiny. Sara
possessed the warmth and wealth of heart which were
the complements his own bleak nature required. Agnes
Carillon, with her accurate, invariable beauty, had a
prim disposition, wholesome enough for a man of
strange, dark humours like David Rennes, but perilous
always in its effect on any frigid or calculating mind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>And Reckage was known to be supremely selfish. It
seemed to Pensée that Sara had behaved very naturally,
very touchingly, through the trying conversation on
the subject of rising men and their marriages. Her
demeanour had been unsurpassable. But it was not
in nature that a woman who understood a man could
look on, inactive and indifferent, while he fettered
himself with some damaging influence. Perhaps her
ladyship felt the situation the more keenly, because,
much as she loved Mrs. Parflete, she could not bring
herself to think that she was the wife for Robert. She
had spent many weeks refusing admittance to this
thought, yet prudence was prudence, and, by virtue of
its stability, it prevailed. The union, even viewed in
the most favourable light, had always seemed imprudent.
It was too hurried. Shocking, mortifying as the
possibility of its being illegal was, Pensée's conviction
that Almighty God ordered all things for the best
seemed less a faith and more a matter of pure reason
than was usual in the ordinary run of hard cases which
made demands upon her piety. &#8220;Two diamonds do
not easily form cup and socket,&#8221; was an old saying in
her home circle. The more she had seen of Brigit
Parflete the more she had been struck with her&mdash;struck
with her moodiness, struck with her contempt
for received opinions, her vigour and independence of
will. Was she the wife to further the advance of a
man of extraordinary ability, already much handicapped
on the world's course by a proud spirit, a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>reckless, impetuous disdain of creatures generally
considered the pink of human excellence? He was
passionately in love, and the strength of this sentiment
carried, for the time, every thought of his being along
with it. But love was not unalterable. The change
would surely come. The fever and folly, the exaltation
and ardours would fade into a sacred affection&mdash;an
instinctive tenderness; yet other interests, as vital, and
in their season more absorbing, would flock into his
life. What then?</p>

<p>Pensée and Reckage did not exchange many words
till they found themselves alone, face to face, in the
railway carriage bound for Dover. Then they looked
with wonder at each other, stupefied at the errand on
which they were bound, and the strangeness of the
whole proceeding. Reckage noticed that his companion
was attired so correctly and with such discretion
that no one could have told she was a pretty woman.
Her veil was not unusually thick, yet it disguised
every charm of expression and feature. He had
bought her a novel, some papers, and a few
magazines; she turned these over listlessly, and
murmured, as the train sped along&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, I had to come. No one will say a
word when the circumstances are known. I hope
poor Renshaw is comfortable in the next carriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reckage replied&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have behaved like an angel!&#8221;</p>

<p>He probably but half understood Pensée's character:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>he underrated her intellect, and he misconstrued
her friendship for Orange into a weak infatuation.
Agnes Carillon shared his view on this point, for, as
he and his future bride could never be confidential with
each other, they managed an appearance of intimacy
by discussing with great freedom the private affairs of
their friends. Agnes, in the fervour of godliness, had
even seen much that was reprehensible in Lady Fitz
Rewes's devotion to a man who had no idea of
marrying her. She had declared that she could not
understand it&mdash;an attitude pleasing to her fancy and
gratifying to her pride. Reckage had thought it was
not quite clear that the danger was immediate. Such
was his feeling now toward Pensée, although he was
conscious of a certain curiosity with regard to her
motive in taking Brigit's part with such magnificent
self-effacement. This seemed to him unnatural; and
although she had impressed him with the highest
opinion of her kindness, he could not believe that a
woman of genuinely tender sensibilities could have
approached such an altruistic height. She was an
excellent creature&mdash;as creatures went, he thought, but
hard in a feeble way. Then he closed his eyes and
called up the elusive image of Sara de Treverell&mdash;very
dark, very handsome, with her superb black hair
reaching to her knees&mdash;as he had often seen it when
she was a little girl&mdash;her blue eyes shining with a
strange light, her lips smiling, her white arms held
out....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Sara may not be a happy girl,&#8221; said Pensée
suddenly, &#8220;but she is a clever one.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reckage started from his reverie.</p>

<p>&#8220;How odd!&#8221; he exclaimed, surprised into candour.
&#8220;I was thinking of her at that very moment.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pensée had read as much on his face, but she did
not tell him so.</p>

<p>&#8220;I feel for her very much,&#8221; she observed instead.
&#8220;She must be the greatest possible comfort to her father,
although he may not realise it. Yet he is forcing on
the engagement to Marshire. She keeps up in the
most courageous way, but she has ideals, and no persuasion
will induce her to change them.&#8221;</p>

<p>He turned red, and said, looking out of the
window&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ideals do no harm when, for some reason or
other, we are unable to carry them out.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot imagine what she will do, or how she
will bear her life if things continue as they are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What things?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is like a slave to Lord Garrow. She is with
him constantly, reading to him, and doing everything
for him. She will be a cruel loss to his home when
she marries.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I rather revel at the thought of the dismay which
will attend her final capture of Marshire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I used to hope that you perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>He glanced up and smiled with an air of satisfaction.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't like the appearance of measuring myself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>against Marshire.... But&mdash;but he certainly seems,
in character, the culminating point of mediocrity! In
fact, Mr. Disraeli, whom I seldom quote, so described
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a husband for that brilliant, affectionate
girl! She likes all that is simple and grand. A real
love&mdash;if it were a happy one&mdash;would make her even
more charming, and if it caused her suffering, it would
make her even more noble. But failing this, there
will be a frightful void in her life.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reckage, whose imagination began to play round
this thought, replied with unusual seriousness&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be horribly grieved to see any declension
from her better nature. I think I am getting to
think less of mere social power. I feel more than I
used to do that, if one could literally <i>live</i> one's theories
on moral strength, it would be a complete refutation
of these ideas about the influence of money or a big
accidental position. Old Harding was right when he
said at luncheon to-day that disinterestedness counted
very highly in the popular vote. The point about
Henry Fox's elopement with Caroline Lennox was
sound.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would not have been sound,&#8221; said Pensée, &#8220;if
Caroline Lennox had been a third-rate woman. A
man can be desperate so long as his choice, on the
whole, justifies, either by her beauty, or her talents, or
something uncommon, an extreme measure. Now,
Robert may not have made a wise choice, but it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>certainly a distinguished one. It can be understood
and it commands respect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, yes, his is a thorough-going emotion, and one
couldn't find a fault with its object. A strong man is
always a man who feels strongly <i>and</i> who can carry
his feeling into action. Robert, with all his mysticism,
is never subject to the deep depressions of spirit
which usually afflict men of his gifts. He does not
know what it is to be languid; or to have invincible
indecisions. He will die game&mdash;even if he does
know German metaphysic backwards!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was astonished.</p>

<p>&#8220;How well you understand him!&#8221;</p>

<p>He leant forward a little and adopted a more
confidential tone&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sara spoke of him at lunch. Her judgment of
men and affairs&mdash;for so young a woman&mdash;is nothing
short of amazing. I attribute it to the Asiatic streak
on her mother's side. It is a kind of second-sight.
What a wife for a Prime Minister! And Marshire,
a fellow of middling ability and no experience, has had
the sense to perceive her qualities!... My feelings
can't be easily defined, nor, indeed, is it necessary they
should.... I have gone so far that I cannot see
anything for it but to go on.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean&mdash;in your own marriage?&#8221;</p>

<p>He sighed profoundly, remained for several minutes
silent, and finally roused himself with a painful
effort.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;There are some griefs which can defy any consolation
save that of time. Time ultimately cures
everything. It is a matter of history that I was once
very much attached to Sara.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; murmured Pensée. &#8220;I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>He covered his eyes with one hand and looked
through his fingers at her face, asking himself by what
transition he could best arrive at a frank exposition of
his embarrassed sentiments. It seemed to him that
she was intelligent as well as trustworthy, and he felt
impelled to call in her assistance, being sure that, in
any cause where love could be pleaded, she would
show a judicious leniency.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you have not observed that I am still&mdash;too
interested, you have not observed with your usual
sagacity,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think&mdash;if I may say so&mdash;that time seems only
to deepen a sorrow of that kind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Particularly when it is associated&mdash;as in this case&mdash;with
a certain self-reproach. In times of trial my
pen is my refuge. I could not write for a year after I
had decided&mdash;irrevocably as I believed&mdash;that Sara and
I could not make each other happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you never actually proposed to her? There
was never any tacit understanding?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never. And if there be any part of my conduct
in life upon which I can look with entire satisfaction,
it is my behaviour with regard to Sara. I did not
mislead her in any way. I was even over-scrupulous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>and purposely avoided opportunities of meeting. I
say this in order that you may know how very
determined a man's will must be&mdash;if he does not
wish to be selfish. A course of struggling is miserable
indeed. I spared her any knowledge of my
misery.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She might have been happier had she known of
it! Last year she remained entirely alone; and
solitude is full of bad things&mdash;it is very dangerous,
however much one is accustomed to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor girl! But I could not, in honour, suffer a
false impression to be formed. As a matter of fact,
my family wouldn't hear of the match. There is
no denying that they were set on my marrying Agnes.&#8221;</p>

<p>At last he had been able to mention her. He leant
back and relied on his companion's tact to elaborate
the theme.</p>

<p>Pensée murmured&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Agnes! If there are storms, they won't
come from her side. She is of a very elevated
spirit&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>He winced, but she continued&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Generous, sternly honest, greatly esteemed by
every one. Neither pique nor passion nor petty
feelings could ever influence her mind. She is the
most angelic, good woman I ever met&mdash;she is one to
whom one may complain, and be a bore. She has
such utter patience!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You would not be impressed by professions, nor
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>am I very clever at making them,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but you
know, by sympathy, that my affection for her is&mdash;is
the heroic feeling of devotion which has also a kind
of exclusiveness&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>He could not finish the sentence.</p>

<p>&#8220;It leads you to imagine that you could never
survive her loss,&#8221; said Pensée gravely. &#8220;But need
you lose her&mdash;as a friend?&#8221; Something in his countenance
encouraged her to pursue this train of thought.
&#8220;Agnes has the deepest admiration for your qualities.
No doubt, you truly realise the high standard of
character which she would hope for in one to whom
she gave her love. You have proved yourself worthy
to call out her best feelings.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reckage was very touched by this tribute.</p>

<p>&#8220;And <i>her</i> best feelings,&#8221; said he, &#8220;ought to make
us&mdash;at our best&mdash;very humble.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pensée lifted her veil just above her eyes, clasped
her hands tightly together, and kept her earnest
glance full upon his.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe,&#8221; she continued, &#8220;that if it were in
man, or woman, to command the heart, you would
have her entire affection. I believe she is unhappy.
During the last week she has had many ups and
downs. She has passed with astonishing rapidity
from the lowest despair to the height of joy. She
has tried to distract her mind by incessant occupation.
But you know her manner&mdash;it is transparent near the
surface, difficult to sound in its depths.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, she has a childlike openness&mdash;up to a certain
point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can only tell you, therefore, what I think,
judging as a woman, by outward signs. I seem to
detect a sort of self-doubt&mdash;as though she feared
making some error. She has become of late strangely
intense and vivid&mdash;she is fascinated by books, and
drawn to music, as she never was before. Perhaps
she sees that you give her a priceless, beautiful
friendship which must indeed be flattering. Yet&mdash;yet
in marriage friendship is not enough. So she is
acquiring a stock of interests which are impersonal.&#8221;</p>

<p>Loyalty to Agnes forbade any reference to David
Rennes. She had no intention of giving the least
hint of her own private conviction on the subject.
She desired merely that Reckage should learn how the
engagement might be broken off without giving
unimaginable grief to the young lady. The move
under this aspect was skilful and successful. Reckage
received her words as a subtle appeal to his honour
and kindness.</p>

<p>He said at once&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad you have told me this. I could bear
my own mistakes. I could not bear hers. Let me
look at the step which I have taken! The choice is
for life. Agnes is inflexibly conscientious and self-denying.
Several years of attachment have tried us
both. She knows my faults; I know where her&#8221;&mdash;he
paused for a moment&mdash;&#8220;her qualities might
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>clash with mine. We spoke of this together; we
considered every circumstance that could, by any
remote chance, weigh against our common happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pensée shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course, that was right,&#8221; she said doubtfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is no easy matter to get a promise from Agnes,&#8221;
he went on; &#8220;but when once given it is inviolate.
This throws a grisly responsibility upon me. I must
risk everything, if I am to do anything. You have
expressed a dread which I have been endeavouring to
stifle. I am making her wretched.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't say that <i>you</i> are making her wretched; I
say she seems disturbed and unsettled when she ought
to be full of the brightest hopes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so. I fear the unsettlement is exceedingly
great. A neutrality on your part is all I could in
reason expect; but your counsel in such a grave
matter&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>Pensée summoned all her energy, and breathed a
little prayer for the well-being of the two women
whose lives were at stake.</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw Agnes this morning,&#8221; she said, speaking at
a rapid pace; &#8220;she came up for some shopping, and
she returned home directly after tea.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She ought to have told me that she was in town,&#8221;
he exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear Beauclerk, you know her sweetness!
She said, &#8216;I don't wish to take up his time; an en<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span>gagement
ought not to be a servitude.&#8217; That is the
reason why she did not tell you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She ought to have told me,&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;Such
extreme delicacy was most uncalled for. It wasn't
even friendly. When we were old friends, and
nothing more, she would have told me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, when you were friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think she gave me a nasty rap in so acting; I
do, indeed. One would infer that I had failed in some
ordinary attentiveness. It is a distinct reprimand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite wrong. She meant it in the
noblest way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it is a desperately near thing between noble
conduct and a downright snub. I can't help lashing
out about it.&#8221;</p>

<p>In Pensée's own private perception this outburst of
temper was no bad sign. It convinced her, at least, of
the sincerity of his feelings towards Agnes and his
genuine desire to behave well at every point in their
relationship.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't you understand,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that Agnes
<i>dares</i> not love you. This being the case, I cannot
see that she could go on in what might be called a
natural way. Will you bear with me, and, if I am
indiscreet, forgive me? She wants all the sympathy
and support she can get. She is suffering very much
from want of courage. She trusts, perhaps, in her
friends' prayers. It seems as though something very
momentous were going on, but that she has nothing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>to do but to wait for it. I think there may be a way
out still; God may overrule people's hearts.&#8221;</p>

<p>She had never intended to say so much, and she
trembled with an excitement which she could not
subdue.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must admit,&#8221; said Reckage, &#8220;that for some
time I have had a conviction, weaker or stronger, but,
on the whole, constantly growing, that Agnes and I
are unsuited to each other. I am too much accustomed
to this idea to feel pain at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, it makes my heart ache&mdash;I mean so much
painfulness for every one concerned!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This conviction must, sooner or later, lead me to
action. The world is indulgent to the impetuous,
because they appear strong; and it is most severe to
those who hesitate, because hesitation is taken for a
sign of weakness. Lookers-on have no patience with
moral combats&mdash;and least of all in affairs of this kind.
But no opinion will force me to do what I do not
think right. If our engagement is a mistake, I don't
intend to &#8216;lump it,&#8217; as they say. We must mend the
evil. And, thank God, it is not too late. The merciful
part is that in relieving my own mind I shall also
greatly relieve hers. It is clear she doesn't love me.
This last act proves the fact conclusively.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pensée did not agree with this, but she remained
silent, fearing lest a rash word should spoil her good
work.</p>

<p>&#8220;For a long, long time,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;my con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>stant
question has been, &#8216;Can this last? is it a
delusion?&#8217; But I do not shut my eyes now. I
knew they were all wrong at home when they made
out that she was in love with me, and expected me to
propose. We are both the victims of an impertinent,
if well-meant, interference&mdash;what Robert calls &#8216;the
jabbering of the damned.&#8217; Poor Robert, we are
forgetting him. I am ashamed to talk so much
about myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In his case, I see no help but resignation to the
will of God,&#8221; said Pensée.</p>

<p>&#8220;But that resignation is an awful thing,&#8221; said
Reckage. &#8220;It is a shade better than the atheism of
despair; yet only a shade better.&#8221;</p>

<p>By degrees Pensée was learning why Robert had
such a strong, tenacious attachment to this man.
He was always faithful to his mood. All he did and
all he said represented accurately all he thought and
all he felt. Some live a dual life&mdash;he lived but one;
and, with his faults, peculiarities, and egoism, there
was never the least dissimulation. It was true that,
if occasion required, he could hold his tongue; but
he abhorred tact and hated doctrines of expediency&mdash;everything,
in fact, which put any restraint upon the
&#8220;development of his inclinations.&#8221;</p>

<p>The train was now approaching Dover. He decided
to put his own troubles aside, and, out of mere
decency, concentrate his thoughts on the severe trial
in store for Orange.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;This business about Parflete,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is a great
blow. One becomes indifferent to what is said of, or
done to, one's self; but that all this uncommon,
saddening, sickening trouble should come upon Robert
is too bad. It seems a kind of hacking and hacking,
bit by bit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are certainly very fond of him,&#8221; said Pensée.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I am. He's so dependable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pensée engaged a private cabin for the crossing, and
she retired there with her maid. Too tired and over-strung
to sleep, she lay down, closed her eyes, and
lived again through the many fatiguing, agitating
moments of that day. Her affection for Orange had
been so steeped in hopelessness from the hour, months
before, when he told her of his love for Brigit, that
the wedding of these two had been a relief rather than
a final anguish. The agonising possibilities which had
sometimes darted into her mind would never again
surprise her: the questions which she had always
striven to prohibit were no longer even in existence.
He had taken the unredeemable step: he was married.
Jealousy had no part in her suffering. Robert had
never given her the smallest right to feel slighted,
or neglected, or abandoned. Some women are jealous
by temperament, but the greater number are jealous
only when their trust is insulted or their dignity
brought down to the humiliating struggle for a lost
empire. Empire over Orange she had never possessed
or claimed: she could feel no bitterness, therefore, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>the thought of the small place she occupied in his
destiny. The sorrow which cut and severed her heart
was loneliness. She felt that, after the wedding, she
could hardly do anything or take interest in anything.
It seemed as if the waters were gathered in heaps on
either side; things, she thought, could not be better,
or worse. God was with her still, and her children&mdash;her
dear children&mdash;were with her still, but she could
not disguise the greatness of the loss. Her single
wish, as far as she dared have a wish, had been to
benefit Robert and to win his confidence. She had
seen his mind working in various directions, and
although she was not, in the faintest sense, his fit
companion intellectually, she had a knowledge and
experience of life which made her friendship valuable&mdash;a
gift worth offering to any man. She had been
able to advise him. Brigit now had even this privilege
also. &#8220;I shall seem an intruder,&#8221; thought Pensée,
again and again.</p>

<p>It was altogether a terrible crisis. How she should
struggle through all the parts of it, or what she should
be when it was over, she could not trust herself to
say. The world seemed too heavy a burden to be
fought against. Yet with what thoughts and aspirations
and earnest prayers she had stood by Brigit's
side at the altar rails. She had been given a supernatural
strength for the marriage ceremony. She was
by nature and before all things, from first to last,
unalterably a good friend, and at that moment of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>intensest difficulty the sight of Robert's happiness had
made her oblivious to every other consideration. Glad
tears had risen to her eyes. She had been swayed by
one feeling&mdash;a deep, sincere thankfulness that his
love-story, which had promised sorrow only from the
very beginning, was ending, unexpectedly, so well.
She might have feared that he was changing one form
of unhappiness for another, but she knew his impatient
spirit, and, knowing it, she could not imagine
that any earthly pain could try him so sorely as a
lifelong separation from the one woman he loved&mdash;loved
to the pitch of madness.</p>

<p>And then&mdash;in one moment&mdash;the strange tidings
came which drove her from the stupor of resignation
to fevers of anxiety more consuming than any
she had ever felt before. A great flame, successive
flames, of terror swept over her, as she feigned
placid sleep in the little cabin, at the thought of
the news poor Reckage would have to break on
the morrow. How would Robert bear it? That
he would act a noble and true part she could not
doubt. But at a certain degree of suffering, the
strongest man can think of nothing except himself,
and she felt already, in anticipation, the dumb torture
she would have to endure in looking on, helpless and
unnoticed, at an agony which she could neither share
nor relieve. The fear of losing him had been dreadful,
but it was even more dreadful to know that
although she might have, after all, a certain right
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>now to offer him sympathy, she could never make
him happy, that she could never hope to learn the
secret regrets, griefs, and torments, the unspoken
broodings which would surely enough prey upon
his spirit. She pictured herself sitting at his side,
or walking with him, for hours&mdash;he absorbed in his
own sorrowful thoughts, she striving vainly to distract
him by a tinkling prattle on every topic except
the one nearest his heart. Oh, how fearfully wide
asunder they were! A sensation of the enormous
distance which can exist between two souls in daily
companionship filled her with a sickening, shivering
heaviness. She thought she would have to cry out
because of the slow fire which seemed to scorch her
dry and aching eyes. Robert would never really need
her, never really care about her. This new trouble
would take him farther away than ever. He would
burn all his ships, and any poor little tenderness he might
have had in the past for her, with them. Some great
revulsion would take place in his character; he would
perhaps grow silent, reserved, enigmatic, his face
would show to the world the terrible, false, unknowable
peace which is the veil of the dead. It was
useless to smooth her difficulties which existed. It was
foolish and wrong to encourage herself in unreal ideas
about him. It was best always to be straightforward
and admit the truth&mdash;no matter how bitter. And
yet he had been kind and helpful to her in a way
in which scarce any one else could have been. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>clung to the belief that she would be able to do something
to make his hour of trial less severe. The hope
which insinuates itself into every unrequited love still
lingered. He could at least always talk to her about
Brigit: that common memory would be a constant
link between them. She had earned his esteem, and
perhaps with his esteem an affection deeper than he
himself realised. Under the pressure of a sudden and
tragical necessity, he would turn to her with the
certainty that she would not fail him. She was
modest enough about her own powers. A remark she
had once heard Reckage pass, to the effect that religious
women of devoted lives were unhappily conspicuous,
as a rule, for feebleness of mind and strength of
prejudice, haunted her as a kind of doom from which
there was no appeal. She knew, too, the verdict
usually passed on those of either sex who have the
courage to maintain an unselfish attitude whether
toward God or some fellow-creature. But here she
comforted herself by deciding that her utter isolation
in this universe rested on the fact that she did not
much deserve to be loved by anybody. This granted&mdash;not
without a pang&mdash;she felt the signs of weariness
in her heart, but none of wavering. She resolved to
be foolish in the eyes of the self-satisfied.</p>

<p>Lord Reckage meanwhile was pacing the deck.
His conversation with Pensée had cast a darkness over
his spirit. He had made up his mind, weeks before,
that the marriage years of his life would be the best,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>the most distinguished, and most useful. With the
utmost pains he had chosen a wife. He had acted
with the greatest caution in no weak or superficial, or
haphazard, or fitful way. Nevertheless, the outlook
was dismal. This first step in decline from his ideal
caused him much pain and restlessness, and led him to
think cynically of many doctrines to which, in serene
moments, he had unconditionally subscribed. He
compared his own case with Robert's. Robert, in
his headstrong passion, had certainly rattled up sleeping
lions, heedless of all consequences, and in
defiance of every warning. He had now met, poor
fellow, with an appalling chastisement, but could any
one pretend that he had not brought it, to a great
extent, upon himself? He (Reckage), however, had
behaved, from first to last, in an unexceptionable
manner. He had studiously avoided the one girl of
whom he was inclined to be immoderately fond.
It was true that he had practised this restraint less in
her interest than his own. But this was because he
feared&mdash;as every creature will fear by instinct its
mortal enemy&mdash;the power of an ardent attachment.
His mind had revolted in a panic at the thought of
becoming dependent on a woman's humours. The
noblest of the sex were capricious, and far and away
the best course was to select a partner whose unavoidable
nonsense would leave one, merely from indifference,
undisturbed. Sara de Treverell, in the past,
had been, by her vagaries, directly responsible for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>several sleepless nights, and a sleepless night was one
of the few things he simply could not stand.
Thoughts of her had seemed to unfit him for his
work, to weaken his nerves, to act, in various ways,
to his disadvantage. She had been exacting in her
demands upon his nature. They were not uttered
demands, or demands which he could formulate, but
he had been conscious of them always. He had
been obliged to pause and ask himself at every
thought, at every step&mdash;&#8220;What would Sara say
to this?&#8221; It was a tyranny&mdash;if not a species
of witchcraft. And so he had determined to
see her no more. Following the usual, most correct
method in such procedures, he went abroad. After a
week of irritating meditations, furtive, all but unconquerable
desires, after he had passed the day on
which it had been his custom for months to call upon
her, after he had learned how to discipline the hours
he had used to spend riding with her in the Row, he
felt as a convalescent after some exhausting malady&mdash;quiescent,
dulled, possessed by a drowsy stupidity,
inaccessible to any serious emotion. He was cured
of his fancy, although no effort of will could protect
the soreness of the bruise. He had persevered in his
course of treatment&mdash;congratulating himself, at the
end, on his escape from a dangerous obsession. The
picture of Sara grew paler and paler before his eyes&mdash;indeed,
it seemed to fade all too quickly, and, with the
perversity of consistent egoism, he felt many twinges
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>of sadness to think that he had forgotten her so soon.
His vanity would have preferred a longer combat&mdash;for
even the most shallow admit the romantic
admirableness of an obstinate love. Still, what could
he ask better than this triumph over a cruel, an
obstructive memory? He had regained, so he believed,
his old independence as the man of action, energetic,
self-controlled, moved by one passion only, and that
the finest of all&mdash;ambition. In surveying once more
the great design of his career, he found it an effort to
bring up&mdash;from the far recesses of his experience&mdash;the
poor little sentimental episode, so insignificant and
commonplace, which, in a kind of aberration, he had
taken for an affair of the heart. He returned to
England. He threw himself with vigour into the
questions which were then disturbing Churchmen.
He revived a touching acquaintance with Agnes
Carillon, an acquaintance which was peculiarly
soothing to his preoccupied mind. Here was a girl,
he thought, who could be a fit helpmate. She asked
for nothing, absorbed nothing, and gave a great deal
of gentle, kind companionship when he wanted it.
When he did not want it, she understood perfectly&mdash;possessing,
in an eminent degree, the rare domestic
art of being able to make herself scarce&mdash;alike in his
thoughts and his engagements. The truths did not
occur to him that a woman in love could never have
been so unnaturally prudent, or that a woman whom
he loved could not have interested him so slightly.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>He took great pride in her perfect skin and hair and
eyes, in her beautiful, graceful, and gracious manners,
but his soul never kindled at her approach, his pulse
beat no slower at her departure. He requited her
agreeableness with respect. And so they had become
engaged&mdash;to the unbounded gratification of all his
relatives, amidst the congratulations of his friends.
There seemed a certain shadowiness in his conception of
their future existence together as man and wife: something
which he recognised as an interior voice chimed
in, from time to time, with provoking interrogations,
mostly unanswerable. A plaintive need of happiness,
melancholy, obscure, but recurrent, mixed in his
fluctuating thoughts. Finally, it pursued him,
haunted him, and caught him with the strange
tenacity of an incorporeal grasp. Sara, now dethroned
from her place of power, loomed in all his dreams.
Irresistibly, he was drawn toward the forbidden recollection
of her delightfulness. There seemed no longer
any danger in these musings. He had entrusted his
actual life to the safe-keeping of the nicest woman he
had ever known. Where then was the harm in
harking back, merely in reverie, to the frivolous,
amusing phantom of a renounced sentiment? Yet,
after a reverie of the kind, why did he often
wonder how he and Agnes could look in one
another's faces and pretend to any sort of real
intimacy? Sara knew him better than he knew
himself. Her sympathy ran into a hundred sinuosities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>&mdash;she
understood his silence as well as his conversation.
He was never conscious of the smallest strain,
the least dissimulation, in her society. Beneath their
curious disparities an identity seemed to unite them.
There was an unrepenting quality in her conscience
which braced and stimulated his moral courage.
Agnes, on the contrary, with her instinct of behaviour,
made him over-cautious and encouraged the tendency
to indecision which interfered with the comfortable
balance of his soul. And he wished his faculties to
work with astronomic punctuality. It is certain,
however, that he would have accepted his choice as a
thing settled beyond any readjustment, but for the
news of the Duke of Marshire's proposal, and the
sight of Sara herself on the fatal afternoon when he
was feeling especially forlorn. She had thrown him
a glance in which defiance, disdain, and an indistinct
affection were blended in one provoking dart. He
was a moralist who believed that there is always,
between men and women, the dormant principles of
mistrust and hatred. He had discussed this theory
frequently with Robert, who found the notion as
repulsive as it was false. But it seemed a truth
beyond contradiction to Reckage, who possessed, in
his own mind, constant irrefutable testimony in
support of the view. Sara had never before defied
him. She had never before seemed to feel her power
as a creature incomparably superior in brilliancy to all
the other girls in their circle. She had never before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>seemed to pity him as a man who had feared to do
what Marshire&mdash;a being considered remarkable only
for his family and his fortune&mdash;had boldly, gladly
volunteered to carry out to the ultimate consequence.
That glance pierced his self-love, his pride, his will.
After his long hesitations, after the wearisome, interminable
debates between his judgment and his
inclination, he decided suddenly, all at once, without
further reflection, that he no longer belonged to
himself. He was the slave once more of doubts, fears,
and temptations. His excited nerves and troubled
senses asserted their right to be regarded as threads, at
least, in the web of destiny. From the hour of that
chance encounter in the Park, till he and Sara met at
Lord Garrow's that day, he had not been able to escape
from the inexorable cruelty of an ill-used passion,
once more, in full command. Every individual has
his rule&mdash;could one but find it out&mdash;and a rule to
which there are no exceptions. With Reckage it
was simple enough: he invariably followed the line of
his own glory. The distress he suffered&mdash;really, and
not colourably&mdash;took its rise from the intervention of
Marshire. He felt as a racing man feels when he sees
a friendless horse, which he might have purchased,
beat the Derby favourite by some three lengths and a
half. He winced at the suspicion that he had committed
an error in judgment, and lost a great opportunity.
The words of Sir Piers Harding on the
subject of audacity in love had fallen on his ears with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>startling force. It was an illustration of that old
saying&mdash;&#8220;The appetite, the occasion, and the ripe
fruit.&#8221; Convinced now that his reputation, his career,
and his comfort depended on his conduct toward
Sara, all hesitation left him. He would have to drive
Marshire, in confusion, from the field, and bear away
the prize himself. Pensée's observations with regard
to Agnes had cleared away most, if not all, of his
difficulties in that particular quarter. No one had
ever accused him of cowardice. Whenever he took
refuge in procrastination or deceit, it was never
because he was afraid, but in order that nothing might
interfere with the purpose he had in hand. The
growing miseries of the situation which he saw, already
in part, served only to augment the violence of his
resolve. His vanity forbade him to believe that
Agnes would not suffer very much when he told her,
as he intended, that they had both mistaken a profound
esteem&mdash;based on reason&mdash;for love, which, as
all the world admits, is something remote indeed
from one's will and one's power. He was desirous to
remain her friend, but he could not, without insincerity&mdash;and
by God's grace, he would not&mdash;continue longer
in a position which was false in itself and an injustice
to each of them. He proposed to dwell very frankly,
but in deep sadness, on the fact that although their
engagement had been a seeming success&mdash;outwardly&mdash;the
success had been by no means proved either to
his satisfaction, or, he ventured to think, to hers. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>would pray that she would not consider herself under
any restraint in speaking freely to him, from her heart,
at all times. He hoped that the inevitable criticism
of malicious or ignorant persons would never shake
her faith in his unwavering loyalty, his singular desire
for her happiness. On the other hand, he did not
wish to involve her in justifying his action to the
world. There was no call for that. She might be
assured that he would do as little as possible to protract
the agony&mdash;he used the word advisedly&mdash;of their
separation. He believed it would be the best way&mdash;if
God gave them the ability&mdash;not to meet until they
had trained themselves to the peaceful, sweet relationship
of their first acquaintance. All this and more he
composed and turned over in his mind as he paced the
deck. His eyes frequently filled with tears, and he
thought how little, how fearfully little, he had ever
suspected this severance from a noble life with which
he had wished most earnestly to join his own. He
was unhappy according to the measure of his capacity,
and he was genuine in so far as he regretted the
necessary suffering of the innocent with the guilty.
But guilt is in the intention, and he could say, with
truth, that he had never intended to give pain, or to
make trouble, in his life.</p>

<p>The Southampton steamer approached St. Malo about
three o'clock on the following afternoon. Robert and
Brigit had spent the night on deck&mdash;it was better than
going below into the close, dreary cabin&mdash;and so they
counted the stars, and kept their gaze, through the
vast reaches of atmosphere, for the first sight of land.
The moon, then at its full strength, lit up the whole
blue dome above them, and cast its glancing, silver path
upon the water&mdash;a path which the ship ever crossed
but never followed. On and on they sped, and, as their
ears grew accustomed to the monotonous churning of
the paddle-wheels, the silence seemed intense. The
splendour of the night made sleep, to minds as passionate
as theirs toward all manifestations of the world's
beauty, impossible. Unconscious of any particular
thought, they shared a dreamless reverie which was so
perfect in its rest and so complete in its still contentment
that they did not know that they were resting,
nor could they realise that such sweet hours, even as
bitter ones, do not loiter in their passing or come again.
Soon enough Robert saw himself very far gone from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>the undissembled sternness of his old resolutions. If
he could but be rid of that altogether! He thought he
had obtained a mystic recognition of the terrorless but
uncommunicating Joy of life which while men live
they pursue, desiring it with the one human craving
which survives every misfortune, every thwarted hope,
all enslavement of the heart's small freedom&mdash;the thirst
for happiness. Was man, whom God had made in His
own Image, but a shadow on the unstable wind?
Could it be true that he came in with vanity and
departed in darkness, his soul bereft of God, knowing
not his time, finding not the work that is done under
the sun, born to companion worms in the dust?
Should he remain unresisting and without influence on
the decision of his own destiny? Yet he remembered
the precept of Christ: &#8220;Whosoever will save his life shall
lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for My sake shall
find it&#8221;&mdash;words which put forth a great mystery, perhaps
a warning. Plainly, in all that a man could bring
to the world, or take from it, there was vanity and
death; but many things were vain merely because they
were not eternal, and many things perished because where
life is, change must be. Immutable, permanent possessions
were the gifts of God to men. But the gifts of
men to God would always be imperfect&mdash;whether they
offered the sacrifice of their wills or their imagined
earthly happiness. Yet if this imperfection were a
mean one, something less grand than the immeasurable
sanctity of Divine strength made human and therefore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>sorrowful, therefore not omnipotent, therefore liable to
error&mdash;where then was the merit of renouncing a manhood
already too squalid to be endured, friends that
were phantoms, loves that were lies, joys that were
void promises invented by the cruel for the disappointment
of the foolish? He looked down at Brigit, who,
wrapped in her furs, was stretched out by his side, her
beautiful, child-like countenance turned toward him,
smiling in faith and deep unspeakable tenderness. He
could hear her tremulous breath and catch the fragrance
of her face, which, in the moonlight, seemed as white
and delicate as a cloud. The knowledge that she
belonged to him at last entered into his heart, his
blood, his brain, his thoughts, became the very life
within his life&mdash;an element which was neither wholly
love nor wholly passion, but a necessity from which he
could not depart and without which he would cease to
be. All men need to have near them, allied in close
association with them, either a force to strengthen their
weakness or else a weakness which insists upon some
demonstration of their strength. In conceivable circumstances
it might be a duty to dissever such a bond;
it might be a duty to die of starvation rather than
steal a loaf, and, as death would ultimately quench the
craving stomach, so a broken soul, in time, would cease
lamenting for its maimed energy. Let heart-sickness
pass beyond a certain bitter-point and the heart loses
its life for ever. Had Robert's marriage been impossible,
had he decided, on that account, to go away
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>from Brigit's influence, had he vowed, in some paroxysm
of despair, to see her no more, to pluck out his eye&mdash;to
forget her&mdash;what would have happened? Would he
have been able to say to himself at the end of three
years, seven years, nine years, &#8220;I did my duty. I have
my reward&#8221;? Is it so easy even to acquiesce in the
great bereavements caused naturally, against our will,
by death? Does one ever, in the hidden depths of the
mind, mistake the cinders of a consumed anguish for
the stars of peace? A man need not be a prophet in
order to foresee the effect of certain measures on his
own character. Indeed, if self-knowledge be not
regarded as a sentinel to the judgment, its laborious
acquisition would be worth the travail of no honest
will. Gained, it remains like an interdict upon all
undertakings, projects, ambitions, setting forth clearly
all that one may, or may not, attempt in common life,
and, above all, in heroism&mdash;heroism understood truly,
not the false ideals of idle, untaxed sentiment. Robert
shrank from examining the sharpest nail of the several
which had been piercing his heart for weeks&mdash;from the
day when he had first received the news of Parflete's
death. Had he not often suspected, until then, that,
for some reason, he had been called to renounce the
hope of marriage? True, he had never been certain of
this, and, certainly, the chain of events, even considered
without prejudice, seemed altogether favourable to an
opposite view. His resolution had been to remain
single so long as he could not marry the woman of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>choice. Firmly enough he had taken his stand on that
ground, realising to the utmost every difficulty to be
encountered, every interest to be thrown aside, from
the exigencies of such a position. The misunderstandings
which would arise, the restraint, the loneliness,
the possible morbidity of his own feeling, the sure
absence of charity in all outside criticism of his conduct,
were not overlooked or under-estimated by a man
so versed as himself in the tariff of the market-place.
He had known full well that his decision, robbed of its
romantic and picturesque motives, would affect very
seriously every step in his career, and influence, as only
violence to one's human affections can influence, his
character, his mode of thought, his whole view of life
and his work in life. This he had known&mdash;known,
that is to say, as much as anything may be known of a
plan not yet executed and destined to a slow accomplishment
which finds its final seal of success or failure
neither in this existence nor in death, but beyond the
grave. Now, however, that the exterior obstacles to
a happier scheme were apparently removed, the more
formidable opposition of his own secret ideals stirred
ominously in his conscience. Men's designs are never
so indefinite and confused as when they meet with no
outward resistance. A close attack has proved the
salvation of most human wills and roused the energy
of many drooping convictions. It is seldom good that
one should enter into any vocation very easily, sweetly,
and without strife. The best apprenticeships, whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>ecclesiastical or religious, or civil or military, or political
or artistic, are never the most calm. Whether we
study the lives of saints or the lives of those distinguished
in any walk of human endeavour where perfection,
in some degree or other, has been at least the goal,
we always find that the first years of the pursuit have
been one bitter history of temptations, doubts, despondencies,
struggles, and agonising inconsistencies of
volition. To natures cold originally, or extinguished
by a false asceticism, many seeming acts of sacrifice are
but the subtle indulgence of that curious selfishness
which is not the more spiritual because it is independent
of others, or the less repulsive because it is most contented
in its isolation from every responsibility. A
renunciation means the deliberate putting away of
something keenly loved, anxiously desired, or actually
possessed; it does not mean a well-weighed acceptance
of the lesser, rather than the greater, trials of life.
When Orange had faced the desolate road before him
it was as though men ploughed into his heart and left
it mangled. Submission to the severities of God
whatever they might be, obedience to authority, a companionless
existence&mdash;these were the conditions, he
knew, of the meagre joy permitted to those who,
full of intellect, feeling, and kindness, undertook the
rigorous discipline of a solitary journey. The world
seldom takes account of the unhappy sensitiveness in
devout souls; it thinks them insensible not only because
they know how to keep silent, but how to sacri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>fice
their secret woes. And what, after all, are the
gratified expectations of any career in comparison with
its hidden despairs?</p>

<p>It may be a fact that love, in every imaginative
mind, approaches madness; on the other hand, the
least imaginative are often not merely attracted but
carried away, without any sort of consent, by some
over-mastering human magnetism. To love well is
a quality in temperament, just as to preach well, or
to conduct a siege well, or to tend the sick well, or,
in fact, to do anything well, is a special distinction,
a ruling motive in the great pursuit of absolute felicity&mdash;a
pursuit which is the inalienable right of all human
creatures, whether fixed mistakenly in this world, or
wisely in the next. No calling can be obeyed without
suffering, but as in the old legend each man's cross
was found exquisitely fitted to his own back, so a
vocation is found to be just when, on the whole, one
has fewer misgivings that way than in any other.
By the exercise of self-discipline one may do much
that is not repulsive only but suicidal&mdash;a man may
so treat his spirit that it becomes a sort of petrified
vapour. When, however, he has dosed, reduced,
tortured, and killed every vital instinct in his nature
till he is an empty shape and nothing more, he must
not flatter himself that he has accomplished a great
work. Life is not for the dead, but for the living,
and in crucifying our flesh we have to be quite
certain that we are playing no ghost's farce, inflicting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>airy penalties on some handfuls of harsh dust. Robert
could not feel that absorbing interest in himself which
enables so many to cut themselves adrift, painfully,
no doubt, from every creature and all impersonal
anxieties. If he wished for fame, power, wealth, it
was that he might use them to the advantage of his
friends, or for the reparation, in some degree, of his
father's sin. But all the joy and all the melancholy
in love give a free rein to egoism, and now that he
had gained, as he believed, the desire of his eyes, the
confused, tyrannical, inexplicable, triumphant selfishness
dormant in him, as in all of us, began to assert its
terrible power. He forgot the agonies, storms, and
fevers of the past. Work had not always been able
to dominate his unrest. There had been times when
he had been compelled to follow the beckoning
dreams; when, in tightening his clasp about the
mockeries of his hope, he lost the pale happiness
which he held already. Whole days had passed when
some oppressive thought had spread its dark wings, as
a bird of prey, over his whole being, crushing him
gradually down to the earth. Now the occasion, the
solitude, the glory of the night cast their spell over
his soul. For the first time his emotion, so long
dumb and imprisoned, found speech. Brigit listened,
almost afraid, to his burning words, which, new and
strange to her, were, in reality, but the echo of his
interior life, his secret intimate thoughts, the pent-up
eloquence of a latent habitual devotion long distrusted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>for its very strength and kept till that hour in strict
silence, lest in the torrent of feeling it should say too
much. The love to which he had long since surrendered
himself now had complete possession of him.
He spoke as he had never spoken before&mdash;as he
never spoke again. The storm was restrained, subservient
possibly still, but it was there, not to be
forbidden, denied, or gainsayed. One has to be very
strong in order to support the realisation of a long
deferred, almost abandoned, hope. Affliction seems
to intensify a personality, adding to it a distinctness,
a power altogether commanding and irresistible, but
even in our purest happiness we lose something of
ourselves, and become, momentarily at least, less our
own masters, and more pliant to the reproof of chance,
the sport of destiny. As Robert uttered his passionate
confession, he was conscious that much in him which
had once seemed strong was conquerable enough, and,
in the torture of the indescribable variety of vague,
menacing feelings which this suspicion called forth,
he revolted against the influence which held him,
which left him neither liberty, nor security; which,
for a few days of mad exultation, cost him a thousand
bewildering, desolating fears. Did he guess that
when one most eagerly desires happiness, one is most
near to it? Already, he remembered, with a sudden
pallor, and a sharp contraction of the lips, that death,
in time, would certainly claim both of them, and his
soul was pierced at the thought, for nothing seemed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>imaginably so perfect as the wild gladness of that poor
human hour then gliding, with pitiless beats, toward
the past. Already the moon had ceased to weave her
magic; the sun rose over the unrebukable sea, and
the distant coast, obscured in a purple vapour, seemed
but a line of darkness against the flushed horizon.
The sky was grey, opalescent in the north, tenderest
green and azure in the east, while large, motionless
clouds, as blue as vine-clad hills, shadowed in great
clusters the vast canopy. But if the dawn of day
wrought a progressive disenchantment of the dreamer,
Robert felt with the recurrence of the morning the
usual prayer rise to his lips in a long weeping, inarticulate
cry to God&mdash;&#8220;Thou knowest that I love
Thee: Thou knowest that all my life is but a desire
of Thee: Thy Will, not mine.&#8221; And he heard
again the promise: &#8220;<i>Thou art My servant, I have
chosen thee, and not cast thee away. Fear thou not, for
I am with thee: be not dismayed, for I am thy God: I
will strengthen thee: yea, I will help thee.</i>&#8221; As the
silent disquietude of night gave place to the intense
tranquillity of day, the impenetrable secret of life,
though still profound, unviolated, and eluding, was
hidden in a shining, though not a blinding, mist.
Was night less night because it paled gloriously before
the sun? Was day less day because it darkened into
evening? Was joy a false thing because it passed?
Did not sorrow pass also? If that sweet journey was
the first and last in all his life, was it not still a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>miracle of blessing, nay, every blessing, to have known
even once the power of mortal happiness?</p>

<p>&#8220;What are you thinking of?&#8221; asked Brigit suddenly,
touching his arm with her hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am thinking that there is but one way of resisting
the woe of life&mdash;the infinite must oppose the
infinite. Infinite sorrow must be met by infinite
love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose we have the sorrow, and the infinite
love is God's. We mustn't call even our love infinite,
Robert.&#8221;</p>

<p>He hesitated for a few moments before he replied&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I call it no name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still,&#8221; she said, &#8220;the very book in which the
vanity of all things is most insisted on has lived itself
nearly three thousand years. Solomon has given the
lie to his own despair of being remembered. This is
why I never feel sad now when I think about the
other fears which made him discontented.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Were they fears? I believe he wanted to conquer
the world, which is strong, and his own weakness,
which was even stronger, as an adversary. We must
know the measure of a man's desires before we can
sound the depths of his regrets.&#8221;</p>

<p>Again she put out her hand, but this time she took
his, following the instinct of a child who finds itself
with a trusted companion in a gloomy road.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing unknown can be wished for,&#8221; she said
gently, &#8220;and so, if some few things did not last, we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>should not have this dissatisfaction at the thought of
their perishing. But what is troubling you? The
greatest cross is to be without a cross. You, dearest,
are never at ease unless you are at least suffering
tortures for some friend.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am thinking of myself now&mdash;myself only. I
can't forget that every supreme blessing must be
bought with long sadness, both before and after, and
now we are together, I am wondering what I
should do&mdash;if&mdash;if we were separated. I must have
the courage to face that thought. I can't put it away
because it has defied me, and when a thought defies
me, I have to meet it fairly. I do not believe in
denying its force, or running away in an opposite
direction. I hear its argument and I try to answer
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She moved towards him and said in a low voice&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have one prayer, and this is that I may outlive
you. When you die, I shall soon follow you. It
won't seem so very long. But if I should die first
I should have to wait, because you would never yield,
and your grief would cut sharply and slowly, a little
more and a little more each day. And although I
might be with you, you could not see me. I should
know all your thoughts and yet I could say nothing.
Almighty God is too kind to let me be so unhappy
after I am dead. This is &#8216;the confidence wherein I
trust.&#8217; This is why I have no fears now. We may
have great trials&mdash;how can we expect to be exempt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>from them? But we must help each other to bear
them and then they will seem more precious than joys.
You see, don't you? You understand, don't you?&#8221;</p>

<p>He could not trust himself to reply. There are
certain utterances, certain turns of thought, which are
so restricted to one sex or the other, so exclusively
feminine or masculine, as the case may be, that their
entire comprehension by both sexes is not possible.
Intuition, imagination, sympathy may help a great
deal; men and women will accept much from each
other which they cannot to their reasoning satisfaction
account for, and, if the difference serves only to
enhance, by its mystery, the melodiousness of the
eternal human duet, it also proves that, while the
singers may be in harmony, they are never in absolute
unison.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know how much I love you,&#8221; said Brigit,
&#8220;you know it. Yet there is an interior cloister of
your mind which you keep wholly to yourself. You
never ask me there. I watch your face&mdash;it tells me
nothing. You have not yet made me your friend.
If you were in trouble you would go to Pensée,
because she is older and she is used to responsibilities.
But you hide things from me because you are afraid
of giving me pain.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is reason enough why I should not tell
you of every passing mood, nor draw you into some
invincible personal sadness, and why I should not
invite you into the &#8216;interior cloister&#8217; of my mind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>Nobody deliberates to do what he cannot help. There
is always something questioning within me, and a
truth is not to be set aside by any other truth whatever.
We can only fix our jaws and grip our hands
in useless wonder at the contradictions of the soul.
I would tell you all my heart,&#8221; he added, with a laugh,
&#8220;but it would take too long!&#8221;</p>

<p>He had been startled by the acuteness of her perception.
Too probably he had carried his reserve to
the selfish pitch, and in over-mastering, with silence,
his own moods, afflicted her who had become now,
by love, inseparable from his spiritual as well as his
outward life. But there is something in beauty&mdash;just
as there is something in youth&mdash;which one fears
to disturb, lest a change should alter, or mar, in the
faintest degree, the sufficient loveliness, the unconscious
charm. Is it not for this cause that many
dependent natures find classic perfection cold, superb
scenery unsympathetic, and the spectacle of careless
happiness embittering? Others, of imaginative temperament,
prefer that their idols should remain impassive,
and, granted the inspiration arising from a
fair appearance, ask no more, but find their delight in
bestowing, from the riches of their own gratitude,
adorable attributes and endless worship. Orange, as
many other men of idealising tendencies, took his
human solace for the discouragements, fatigues, and
ordeals of life in the mere existence of the woman he
loved. He was at the moment of humility which is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>the first and last in all really great passions. He
asked for nothing; it was all too glorious even to
have the privilege of offering gifts, of feeling the
readiness to die ten deaths for her sake, of finding all
the recompenses of eternity in the soft depths of her
bright eyes. But as he was too much in earnest to
analyse these sentiments, he could neither gauge his
own reticence nor justify it to Brigit herself. Nor
could she, with all her tenderness and womanly
instincts, help him in that matter&mdash;their one possibility
of estrangement. She lacked the knowledge which
renders verbal confidences unnecessary; she was too
loving and too human to be happy as an inspiration
and an inspiration only; she also had a great desire to
give, to aid, to prove her devotion, to be the friend
and the fellow-pilgrim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p><h2><a name="CHAPTER_XII" id="CHAPTER_XII"></a>CHAPTER XII</h2>


<p>Brilliant sunlight lit up the grey spires and threatening
pinnacles of St. Malo. The back of the ancient
fortress was hidden in white mist, but the houses
which rose above the battlements facing the harbour,
and the shops and little taverns near the quay, shone
out in brightness, their windows glittering under the
sky where straying clouds, driven by the wind, were
melting, as they fled, into the all-encompassing blue
ether. Some pigeons and wild gulls circled above the
earthworks, darting down, at times, between the
massive oak piles which, forced deep into the sand,
were covered with shining seaweed. The piercing
note of the military bugle, the crack of the cabmen's
long whips, the clatter of wooden shoes, and the
Angelus bells then chiming, made up a volume of
sound which fell on Robert's ears with all the poignant
strangeness of an old song heard again after many
years. A hundred memories flocked into his mind at
the first distant view of that familiar scene: memories
of his boyhood, its errors, its visions, its ambitions;
his revolt against nature as he understood it, and his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>desire to keep his heart and soul and senses for the
service of God, and the custody of his own ideals.
The very centre of his thoughts was here: here he had
found the first beginnings of his faith and love. How
often he had walked alone upon those ramparts with
his New Testament and the <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>, striving,
in the fervour of romantic sentiment, to combine the
standards of knightly chivalry with the austere counsels
of the gospel. The divinity of Christ is the object
of eternal contemplations, and at every age&mdash;not of
the world only, but of the individual&mdash;His Humanity,
under our fresh knowledge, demands a different study
and a fuller understanding. What changes, therefore,
experience and suffering had wrought in those early,
untried speculations! The ideals remained, but they
made for swords, not peace; the sweetness of the
dream had become an inflexible law of conscience;
the doctrine of a transcendent disdain of this world,
accepted in solitude by the obscure youth brought up
in a provincial town, had exacted its tax to the uttermost
farthing from the man who struggled now with
the rich and powerful in a great city of the great
universe of affairs.... He thought of his dead godmother,
Madame Bertin, with her still, pale face and
beautiful hands&mdash;a cold, blameless woman who had
treated him kindly and misunderstood him always.
She had been his father's friend; she had loved him, in
her own stern, silent fashion, for his father's sake. O,
if she might only know now how much he treasured
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>every impression he had formed of her strong character!
She had given him all the tenderness she had,
and all the motherly influence his childhood had
received. What might his life have been without
that early association with a noble if somewhat restricted
nature? But these and similar thoughts, while
they went deep, passed swiftly and did not return
again till a very different moment, when they came
with agony and remained for ever.</p>

<p>He and Brigit were the last to leave the boat.
They had been so happy there that, by an instinct,
they lingered behind the others, unwilling to break
the enchantment of their isolation from the land, and
half-dreading the unknown trials, or joys, which
awaited, surely enough, their first steps upon the soil.
As they crossed the plank they looked back, obeying
a common impulse, at the deserted deck. Their
chairs had already been moved away, and the leeward
corner, which had seemed so much their own, was
filled up by a small group of sailors who were
quarrelling about the division of <i>pourboires</i>. The drive
to Miraflores is long and winding, past several small
villages, and approached finally through a large tract
of fields and orchards. But for the changing crimson
of the vines, it might have been August weather.
Robins, however, were singing, and the golden, brown,
and russet butterflies of autumn were floating languidly
above the wayside hedges. The cawing of rooks, the
cooing of wood-pigeons, and the hum of insects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>invaded the stillness of the lonely farms which, at long
distances, gave picturesque evidence of the human toil
expended on the careful, rather melancholy charm of
that northern landscape. The Villa Miraflores&mdash;an
elaborate reproduction of the celebrated Villa Madama
near Rome&mdash;stood on a wooded hill rising out of a
river, facing the rocky sea-coast. Built by the Archduke
Charles of Alberia for his morganatic wife,
Henriette Duboc, and pulled down since for the
erection of a convent, it is never mentioned in history,
and it has been long forgotten by the few inhabitants of
the neighbourhood. But as the young couple entered
the lodge gates that day, and drove along the stately
avenue, the beautiful ill-fated structure rose before
them as some castle in the air brought down to earth
by a magician's wand. Was this their home? They
dared not speak lest the vision should fade too soon.
But Orange remembered it all&mdash;this was no dream.
There were the winding alleys leading to peeps of
water, land and sky; there was the path which he had
followed, years before, in search of his destiny. He
drew a long breath, drinking in the intoxicating
strength of the fresh sea air wafted through pine-trees.
The atmosphere was charged with the very madness
of youth and joy. Who could have hoped for such a
miracle as this? Had the whole course of fate a like
to show? Did it not seem a triumph over life and its
threatened deceptions? His own servant and Brigit's
maid&mdash;whom they had sent there some days before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>&mdash;were
watching for them at the open door, and the
sight of those well-known faces gave him a still
further assurance of the scene's actuality. They
crossed the hall without noticing a small blue telegram
on one of the malachite tables. They walked together
through every room, wondering at their treasures,
looking out of the windows, amazed, bewitched,
gradually becoming used to the fact of each other's
company in such a solitude. What were the woes
and cryings of the outer world to them, lost in the
impenetrable silence of that retreat? A strange,
double sensation of delight and forgetfulness surged in
them both. All knowledge of disturbing human
influences, of the fret, and discord, and inquietude of
common existence seemed trivial and even false.
They looked with confidence into each other's eyes, as
though they were the sole inhabitants of some brilliant,
inaccessible star set far above the earth and its evil.
They were to remain there a month&mdash;one month at
least&mdash;and after that would trials, or labour, or sorrow
deluge in bitterness the sweet, eternal recollection of
such days? A table had been set for them in one of
the small pavilions leading on to a balcony. The
scent of flowers, mingling with the sunlight, came in
through the open windows, bringing the garden's
freshness to the faded lilacs on the carpet and tapestry.
Brigit went to the looking-glass, took off her hat, and
apologised for her &#8220;frightful appearance.&#8221; She had
thrown her veil and gloves on the sofa, and the mere
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>sight of them there gave a homeliness to that forsaken
room which, with its rococo decorations, painted ceilings,
and gilded doors, had something of the dead
gaiety of an empty theatre. Brigit made the tea,
following the English custom taught her by Pensée.
Was the water boiling? Did he like sugar? How
absurd not to know whether one's husband took
cream! The two had seen so little of each other in
domestic surroundings that this little commonplace
intimacy had an intoxicating charm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you happy?&#8221; she asked suddenly. &#8220;Do you
know that you are all I love in the world, and I am
yours for ever and ever?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And how much do you love me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall never be able to say how much.&#8221;</p>

<p>She took his hand, kissed it, pressed it to her heart,
then asked him, with some confusion, if he liked
grapes better than pears.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are so beautiful,&#8221; he replied.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to-day,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;to-day I am quite
dull. But you are handsome. I saw them looking at
you on the boat. And I was proud&mdash;oh, so proud to
think that you were mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>When they had finished their meal, she opened the
piano and struck out some chords, which echoed with
a kind of wail through the long corridors outside.
The instrument was out of tune, and the strings
seemed muffled.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Something is inside,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>They looked and discovered a few sheets of music
which had slipped down upon the wires. The sheets
were dusty, stained with age, blurred by damp, but
one bore the name &#8220;Henriette&#8221; written in the corner
in a large, defiant hand. Joining the fragments, they
found it was an arrangement in manuscript of Poe's
ballad, &#8220;Annabel Lee.&#8221;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<i>
<span class="i0">It was many and many a year ago,<br /></span>

</i>
</div></div>

<p>As Brigit read aloud these words of haunting
pathos, the very trees, rustling outside in the October
wind, the far-away sound of the waves beating upon
the sand, seemed to Robert an ominous accompaniment&mdash;half
a warning, half a promise.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I wonder why that was
there?&#8221;</p>

<p>He was uneasy, he could not say why. He was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>conscious of some influence in the room. He felt,
unaccountably, that they were not alone. Looking
round for some confirmation of this strange instinct
his eyes fell on the small blue envelope which had
been placed on the mantelpiece by his servant. It
was addressed to himself. Fortunately, whilst he was
opening it, Brigit's attention was still riveted on the
old song which she was humming over at the piano.
She spoke to him three times before he answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;This telegram,&#8221; he said, at last, trying to control
his voice, &#8220;is from Reckage. He is on his way now
to see me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is coming here? Why is he coming here?&#8221;</p>

<p>He put his arm round her, in a desperate, long
embrace, kissing her face, her eyes, her hair.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is it, Robert?&#8221; she said, clinging to him,
for she heard something like a sob under his breath.
&#8220;You have had bad news. You must tell me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may not be so serious ... perhaps it is badly
worded ... but Pensée is coming with him and he
says quite plainly that there is some legal difficulty
about our marriage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some legal difficulty!&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;What is
the use of that now? I can't leave you again. I'll die
first. I can't bear it. O, Robert, I am so tired of
the law. There are no laws for the birds, or for the
flowers, or for the trees, or for any thing that is happy!
Why should we be made so miserable&mdash;just to please
the magistrates and mayors!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it is more than that&mdash;I am certain. Suppose
it has something to do with Parflete?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With Wrexham? How could that be? He is
dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He may not be dead.&#8221;</p>

<p>She sank down to the floor on her knees.</p>

<p>&#8220;O my God! You know that he is living.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckage doesn't say so. But would he and
Pensée come unless they felt we should need them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I need no one except you. I don't want to see
them. I don't want to hear their news. They are
killing you. You seem calm, but your face! you
have never looked like this before. O, darling, it
can't be what you think it is.&#8221;</p>

<p>He lifted her from the ground and took her in his
arms again, as though he could defy the cruel, invisible
fate which had decreed their separation.</p>

<p>&#8220;In any case,&#8221; he said, &#8220;I won't give you back&mdash;I
cannot. It is too much to ask. You are mine&mdash;you
were never his&mdash;never. God is not unjust, and
this is unjust. As for other people and outside opinion,
they have not mattered to me at any time, and least
of all can they matter now. I won't give you back.&#8221;</p>

<p>She held him closer, already feeling, in spite of his
words, the first agony of their inevitable farewell.</p>

<p>&#8220;You love me!&#8221; she said, &#8220;you must never leave
me. Kiss me, and promise me that you will never
leave me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Grief and horror had broken down every barrier of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>reserve between them. The pent-up passion on his
side, the intense unconscious tenderness on hers seemed
to meet and blend in the one consuming thought that
they belonged to each other&mdash;that, in the awful
struggle between the force of circumstances and the
force of life&mdash;they might have to part.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should we two matter in so large a world?&#8221;
she cried. &#8220;Surely we need not suffer so much just
for the discipline of our own souls? I cannot, cannot,
cannot go away. I can't live without you. I can't
die without you. I am tired of being alone. I am
tired of trying to forget you. And I have tried so
hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her face, from which all colour and joy and animation
had departed, seemed like a June rose dead, in
all its perfection, on the tree. One may see many
such in a garden after a sudden frost.</p>

<p>&#8220;You mustn't leave me. They all frighten me.
I have no one but you,&#8221; she continued; &#8220;God will
understand. He doesn't ask any one to be alone. He
wasn't even crucified&mdash;alone. He didn't enter into
Paradise&mdash;alone. Ask me to do anything, but don't
ask me to go away&mdash;to go back to Wrexham. You
are much stronger than I am. If you thought you
ought to cut out your heart by little pieces, you would
do it. But you must think of me. They may have
all my money&mdash;that is all they care for. But I must
have you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although she made the appeal, he had resolved, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>silence, long before, that, come what might, he would
not give her back. The decision rose on the instant,
without hesitation, doubt, or misgiving&mdash;a deliberate
choice between two courses.</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot return to Parflete,&#8221; he said quietly.
&#8220;Don't despair. Your marriage with him may be
annulled. That aspect of the question is revolting,
abominable; but we are both in such a false position
now that we owe it as much to other people as we do
to ourselves to put everything in a true light. You
are so brave, Brigit&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am tired of being brave.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her slender arms tightened about his neck; he
could feel, from the whole abandonment of her attitude
and the slight weight of her childish form, how little
fitted she was physically for the squalid ordeal of the
law-courts. If she could live at all through horrors
of the kind, it would have to be by a miracle. And
has one the right to hope for miracles where the
question of happiness or unhappiness in human love
is the egoistic point at stake? But, right or no right,
there was in them both that supreme and fatal force
of affection which, if it be unusual, is at least usual
enough to be at the root of most mortal tragedies.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am tired or being brave,&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;I
want to rest.&#8221;</p>

<p>In the mirror opposite them he saw the reflection
of the bright garden outside. How calm and still it
seemed! Had he wandered there, years before, with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>a beating heart, in search of his destiny, merely to find
it at last after the humiliation of a public scandal?
Had his idyllic, almost mystical romance, with all its
aspirations, grace, and unspeakable strength, been
given to him just to be called from the house-tops and
discussed in the streets? Was this the end of all
sublime ideals? Did every delicate, secret sentiment
have to endure, soon or late, the awful test of degradation
and mockery? Did it have to come&mdash;this
terrible day of trial when the Love which moves the
sun and the other stars had to pass through the common
sieve with dust, ashes, and much that was infinitely
viler? No, he told himself, no: ten thousand times,
no.</p>

<p>&#8220;Listen,&#8221; he said, &#8220;listen. You need not go back
to him: he knows&mdash;every one knows now that we
love each other. We can't live together because our
marriage is not a marriage. Your marriage with
Parflete was not a marriage, but it appears so to the
world. Is it worth while to undeceive the world?
When I think of the cost of such a proof&mdash;I say it is
too great. But it you are courageous&mdash;and you will
be for my sake&mdash;we can defy every one&mdash;on one condition.
We must be sure of <i>ourselves</i>. We must
know that we can depend on ourselves. We may
have to separate now for some months&mdash;perhaps a
year&mdash;perhaps longer; we must school ourselves to
look upon each other as friends&mdash;friends, nothing
more. It will be very hard&mdash;for me, and it is on my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>account only that we must separate now. But you
will accept this, even if you cannot understand it,
because my life here depends on you. I don't say
anything about my happiness. I leave that out of the
reckoning. But if I am to live&mdash;to get through the
day's work, I must love you and I must see you.
Later on, we may be able to meet quite often. This
will be something to which I can look forward. All
this has been in my mind always&mdash;ever since I first
met you. I feel now as though every thought, every
hour, every event of the last five months has been a
preparation for this moment. On one point, however,
I have never wavered. We can't desecrate our love
by some odious law-suit. If this life were all, it would
be different. But it isn't all. It seems as though we
are not to be everything to each other. Yet we can
be more than everything&mdash;we can be one existence
even if we cannot be man and wife. We can help
each other, we may see each other&mdash;in time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In time?&#8221; she repeated. The certainty that she
would have to be deprived of his presence for the
greater part, at all events, of her life came over her
with intolerable anguish, and with it she felt a presentiment
of the future struggle to be waged against
the profound instinct which drew them, with all the
strength of a river's current, toward each other.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no,&#8221; she said, &#8220;if you send me away, I shall
die. They frighten me; they tell me lies. My
mother is dead; my father is dead. I have no one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>but you. You can't forsake me. You love me too
much. I know you won't leave me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her innocence made the recklessness of her appeal
the more compelling. The beseeching, intense affection
of her soul transfigured her face with an almost
unearthly sweetness. White, trembling, and despairing
she laid her head upon his shoulder, holding him with
both arms, and swaying from the agony of a grief
without hope and without tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must try to understand,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you must
try. You are so young&mdash;such a child, but you do
know that we can't live together, in the same house,
if our marriage is not valid. That would compromise
your honour. How else can I say what I
must say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shouldn't mind. God would understand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But the world wouldn't understand. And one
has to avoid the appearance of evil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They may say anything they please. I should
be very proud if they misjudged me for your sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then a thought suddenly pierced her. What
would they say about his honour? Would the
world misjudge him? Her weakness became strength
under coercion of this new possibility; her cheeks
burned at the light thrown upon her first selfish
impulse.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, why have I said such things?&#8221; she said, tearing
herself away from him, &#8220;and I used to think once
that women like me were too bad to live. I used to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>wonder how they could be so evil. That was because
I had never been tempted. And now I see how hard
it is&mdash;how hard to fight. It is so easy to judge others
when you are married to some one you love. But I
begin to understand now&mdash;I ought to hide myself in a
cell and pray till I die for women who are unhappy.&#8221;</p>

<p>She pushed back the soft golden hair which had
fallen a little over her face, brightening its sorrow.
Every feature quivered under the invisible cutting hand
of cruel experience. In those last sharp moments of
introspection she had gained such a knowledge of
suffering that a fire seemed to have consumed her
vision of life, reducing it to a frightful desert of
eternal woe and unavailing sacrifice. Partially
stunned, and partially blinded by misery, she felt the
awful helplessness and pain of what is sometimes called
the second birth, a crisis in all human development
when the first true realisation comes that the soul is a
stranger, a rebel, strong as eternity, weak as the flesh,
free as the illimitable air.</p>

<p>&#8220;O, I do understand!&#8221; she said. &#8220;I have been
pretending to myself that we could do impossible
things. But I didn't want to speak my own death-warrant.
No, don't come to me. Don't say one
word to me. I know so well now what must be
done. We mustn't hesitate&mdash;we mustn't think. It is
something to know where you can't trust yourself. I
can't trust my heart at this moment. So I must just
depend on the things I have been taught&mdash;things
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>which I accepted, oh, so easily, when I applied them
to other people. You must go away. You must leave
me here with the servants. Esther is good and kind.
Pensée chose her for me. You can leave me with
her.&#8221;</p>

<p>She supported herself by holding, in a desperate
grasp, the heavy silk draperies by the window. The
image of her, leaning against the faded scarlet curtain,
tall, fragile, yet resolute, with heaving breast, closed
eyes, and pallid lips, remained before him night and day
for months, and though, in the process of time, the
vividness of the picture waned, it lived always among
his unforgettable impressions.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must leave me,&#8221; she said again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I will come in the morning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will rest, you will try to sleep&mdash;for my sake.&#8221;</p>

<p>This time she lifted her head, and, turning towards
him, met once more the glance which she felt must
have called her to life had she been dead.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will come in the morning?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>Once more she held out her arms. He kissed her
mouth, and eyes, and hair once more. Neither could
speak, and both were tearless. Then she went with
him to the door, opened it, and seemed to lead the
way through the long corridor, down some stone steps
to the garden. She knew that he would not leave the
spot while she was in sight. So she walked back to
the house alone and mounted the steps, turning at each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>one to wave her hand. He saw her enter at last, and
close the window. Then she fell and was helpless till
she was found by Esther. Robert watched till the
lights were lit, and for some hours after they were
finally extinguished. The stars came out, and the
moon made the languid night seem white with beauty.
Orange walked toward the town and the small
cemetery where Madame Bertin was buried. Then
he threw himself by the lonely grave which held the
one creature on earth whom he seemed to have a right
to love without scruple and without restraint. And
there he remained till daybreak, weeping.</p>

<p>Lady Sara had written to the Duke of Marshire,
and so fulfilled, in part, her promise to her father.
But, while she said much that was graceful, coquettish,
and characteristic, the Duke felt unable to regard
it as an acceptance of his offer. She was very kind
with that kindness which has no sort of encouragement
in it. Among other things, she begged for
another week on the plea that &#8220;seven days furnished
a very short speculation when the result might possibly
decide the whole course of her life.&#8221; In much
anxiety, for his Grace was very much in love, he
composed, after three hours of careful thought, a reply,
and, having read the least tender but most sensible
passages to his lawyer, he himself left the communication,
together with a beautifully bound copy of
&#8220;Lettres Choisies,&#8221; by Madame de Sévigné, at St.
James's Square. The parcel and the missive arrived
when the young lady was reading and re-reading two
other letters which she had received that morning
from the North of France. One was from Lord
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>Reckage; the other was from Pensée Fitz Rewes.
Their respective contents ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">My dear Sara</span> (I love the sweeter name of Valérie:
may I not use it sometimes?),&mdash;I shall never be able to
get through all I have to say&mdash;no words can reflect the
fulness of human nature in such suffering as it has been
my privilege&mdash;and sorrow&mdash;to witness here. In doubt,
they tell us, we must stand on the rule of authority.
But for this principle I should find it hard to reconcile
myself to this deplorable affair of parting two people who
love each other, evidently, in an almost lyric sense.
You, I know, will understand that this expression contains
no sneer at a frame of mind altogether surpassing
my own capacity for idealism. Are there many, or
any of us nowadays, who feel that there are certain
things which we must do, not do, or perish eternally?
I have never detected this narrow, vindictive, inherently
superstitious view in Orange. I am forced to the
conclusion, therefore, that his truest happiness consists
always in his submission to the Will (as he understands
it) of God (as he understands Him). Men are like
horses&mdash;unless they are born with staying powers in
them, no amount of training can make them really stay.
Robert is a born ecclesiastic&mdash;I have said so always. His
conduct in this present crisis will be a slap in the face
to those who insist that religion makes men timorous.
Speaking for myself, I never entertained a moment's doubt
of his acting in precisely the manner in which he has done;
his worst time, however, is, alas! to come; he may have
to wait till eternity for his recompense. That trial often
embitters the most constant. The devil is never embarrassed,
and where virtue is found superhuman, he takes
every care to keep it on a sour&mdash;if ethereal&mdash;diet. You
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>will beg for less comment and more facts. Let me give
them. Orange himself, pale, restrained, haggard but
superb, met us at the station on our arrival. He had
been waiting for us at the hotel; Mrs. Parflete was at
the Villa Miraflores. The two had discussed the situation
and parted on the mere reading of my telegram. I
cannot say that they might have acted otherwise, but only
that they acted as they did. There must have been,
nevertheless, a considerable scene. The idealist driven
into squalid actualities deserves a martyr's crown. In
one single misfortune he suffers all the calamities of the
human race, and in one personal horror he sees the death,
emptiness, and corruption of all human endeavours. In
this exaggeration, these mystics show their genius; they
suffer too much in order that ordinary people may suffer a
little less. Poor Orange! He is certainly fine, for, even
if I discard the <i>mannerisms</i>, the eccentricity, the possibly
<i>natural</i> self-sufficiency, all that is essential in his character
remains and must remain undeniably chivalrous. It was
an immense relief to find that he had decided, without
suggestions on my part, on his course of conduct. I hate
a fellow who tries to be more than friendly, and I dreaded
making the experiment. I did venture to point out to
him that there might be some way of annulling the
Parflete marriage. But idealists abhor law-suits. Parflete,
<i>not</i> being an idealist, may take some steps on his own
account. I refrained from touching on that possibility,
although I see much hope that way for our unhappy
lovers. The world might cry out a little at first, but
success justifies everything. Meanwhile, Robert and Mrs.
Parflete have formed a resolution not to meet again for a
year or more. After that, they hope to be on the unearthly
terms of Laura and her Petrarch. It is magnificent, but
is it love? I long to hear your views on the subject. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>have no influence over you; I wish I had. I am the
most sincere of all your friends. The others either care
too little for you, or too much for themselves, to run the
risk of giving you offence. But I would risk all, to gain
even a little&mdash;where you are concerned. May I call on
my return? Orange comes back with me. His own instinct
tells him that there is a suggestion of the ridiculous&mdash;to
the mere on-looker&mdash;about this interrupted honeymoon.
He has determined to face it out in London,
and resume his life on the old lines. He will finish
his volume of French History, resume his post with
Lord Wight, and take his seat in Parliament. If he
can succeed in living down this absurdly tragic catastrophe,
he will achieve a notable triumph. It gives me a
cold feeling at the heart when I think of the dreary
heroism he must display. Nothing picturesque, nothing
striking. He must simply baffle the scoffers by an inscrutable
endurance. Mrs. Parflete is a beautiful creature,
but quite a child, and therefore weedy as to figure. I consider
her far too young for marriage in any case. She is
only seventeen&mdash;tall, slight, with a transparent skin, and
something actually <i>babyish</i> about the eyes. Her dignity,
in the circumstances, was wholly admirable. Perfectly
self-possessed. Pensée will describe the interviews far
better than I could, so I will refer you to her for the
details of our mission. Women, I have decided, in every
disappointment always look for some future change of
circumstances favourable to their wishes. No matter how
nominal, shallow, and delusive this faith may be, it
sustains them through the worst trials. Thus it is that
when a woman sacrifices either her repose or the legitimate
compensations of life to a great idea, she suffers
far less than a man in similar conditions. The devout
female sex drive a good bargain always: they manage
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>somehow to obtain all the sentiment they require from
both worlds. Men cannot be happy on sentiment alone;
hence, therefore, the dreadful hesitations, self-doubts, and
terror which assail so frequently the interior peace of all
men drawn, like Orange, by certain qualities of temperament,
toward the mortification of their humanity. Laying
aside the proud idea of the independence, vigour, and
spiritual-mindedness which this practice is held to secure,
there is one drawback which, with a view to that class
who are really willing to endure many afflictions for the
sake of any one definite advantage, ought not to be
overlooked. The weak, under such discipline, become
sugary: the strong grow hard. Robert has backbone;
he is a man of ability, perhaps even genius, but there is
always a danger that, either from the accumulation of
scruples or the want of romantic incentive, he may throw
up the political game and bury himself in a monastery
where his dreams may find their sole expression in prayer.
Another point occurs to me. Will the rank and file ever
trust a person so far above their comprehension? The
very word &#8220;mystical&#8221; is a word of reproach in the mouth
of the world. People continually ask questions about
Robert. No questions, on the other hand, are asked
about Aumerle. Aumerle lives like the rest of us: he does
everything he ought not to do&mdash;he surprises nobody: he
delivers his neighbours over to the absolute power of
accomplished facts. (A way of saying that he doesn't
care a rap about the fellow who falls among thieves.)
Dear Valérie! What a pleasure it is to write to you!
I can utter my inmost thoughts. I am often suspected
of callousness. This letter will show you how truly I feel
the sorrows of my few real friends. I cannot bear to
think that Orange should be beaten, as it were, by
Parflete. A more fawning, wretched creature than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>Parflete one never saw. I shall not be set right in my
own idea of the Divine Justice unless this battle, at any
rate, is to the strong. Write to me. I don't want to
whine, but I may tell you that I am not happy.</p><p class="i8 nospaceabove">Your affectionate friend,</p><p class="i12 nospaceabove"><span class="smcap">Beauclerk R.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Sara sat on a low, embroidered stool by the fender,
and, as she studied each line of his lordship's despatch
(for so he regarded it), she would dip her fingers from
time to time into a blue satin sweet-box, select, after
due consideration, a chocolate or a sugared-almond,
and nibble it somewhat fastidiously, with an air of
making concessions to her human side. The exercise
of divining the many hidden meanings in Reckage's
epistle was certainly purely intellectual. Nevertheless,
as she read the last sentences, she smiled with malicious
triumph, for did they not convey a declaration of strong
friendship in a letter designed, beyond doubt, as an
argument in disfavour of all merely sentimental ties
between men and women, and as a frank confession or
his own inability to sustain any relation of the kind?
How often had he maintained an opposite opinion&mdash;seeming
contemptuous, indolent, invulnerable, unconscious
of her beauty, amused rather than attracted by
her brilliant spirit. Every instinct of the coquette,
jealous of her own power and wretched from the sterile
suffering of wounded pride, resented bitterly the unpardonable
ease which he had appeared to enjoy in her
society. Now, however, that he appealed to her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>womanliness by a humble surrender, her better, more
generous nature asserted itself. Some of the old
affection she had long felt for him revived. Where
there had once been love, a kind of desperate fidelity
still lingered, and, although Robert Orange was the
ideal passion of her heart, Reckage possessed a certain
influence over her which was not the less powerful
because it had its root and constant nourishment in
their common memory of a childhood and first youth
spent together in the same county, with the same
friends and the same bores. She slipped his letter,
with a sigh, into her belt, and turned her attention for
the third time to Pensée's tear-stained pages.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">My darling Sara</span>,&mdash;I can scarcely write. Although
I know the mercy and wisdom hidden in these sad events,
my heart is heavy. The best thing is to preach resignation
<i>till</i> you have it; and then, <i>because</i> you have it, you <i>will</i>
preach it. Robert's love of Brigit makes little outward
show, but I know that it is terribly real. We are never
so near to our loved ones as when we have left them for
God, but <i>nearness</i> of that intangible, invisible kind amounts
to agony. At least, I think so. Robert's self-restraint is
killing me. When we first met, he shook from head to
foot, his very face quivered, but he said nothing. I felt
that he would never allow any one to speak of this trouble
or offer him the least sympathy. In the necessary discussion
of the legal aspects of the case, he was very calm,
and seemed rather an adviser himself than the person
chiefly concerned. It is not easy to understand him; yet
I appreciate reserve. If everybody could understand us,
what joy would there be in discovering our souls to those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>whom we love! Brigit has shut herself up in a room.
She cries incessantly (she is so young) and is dreadfully
changed. She wishes to go to Paris&mdash;for she has some
idea of resuming her musical studies. Her voice is one of
her great gifts, yet I can't imagine any one singing in such
a tortured state of mind. I don't like to say that actually
I fear for her reason, but she has, I see, far more heart, poor
child, than I ever supposed. How wrong it is to attempt
any judgment or estimate of another person's capacity for
suffering! She is in a pitiable condition, unnaturally
patient in a sense&mdash;for it is patience on the rack. Our
Lord dreaded suffering and even feared it. Of course,
one might easily say that an unhappy love affair is very
common, that it is almost profane to compare such an ordinary
trouble with the serious, exceptional trials of life.
But although Lord Byron declared that &#8220;man's love was of
man's life a thing apart,&#8221; his own poems and his own
career gave the lie absolutely to the statement (indeed, I
am often tempted to believe that women exhibit, on the
whole, greater strength of will in their affections than men).
I must say, therefore, that the spectacle of a bride and
bridegroom, devoted to each other, yet separated on their
very wedding day, is quite as serious and sorrowful as (say)
the death of a parent, or the loss of a child, or any other
melancholy occurrence of everyday life. And what is worse,
an atmosphere of <i>scandal</i> penetrates this story&mdash;making it
most shocking to all refined minds, and peculiarly so to
temperaments of extraordinary delicacy. It will take
every atom of <i>my</i> courage and constant prayers to bear it
<i>for</i> them. What must it be, therefore, to themselves?
I tremble at the appalling things in future for us. As for
my uncle, I dare not read his letter yet. He must be so
upset, so <i>horrified</i>. I have never before been called on for
such a proof of friendship. It is quite dreadful to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>mixed up in a kind of <i>cause célèbre</i>. The great justice of
God is always mixed with great hardships, and is often
executed by those worthy neither of confidence nor respect.
I am sure that we shall all have to go through many
humiliations before this matter is settled. I know, darling,
that <i>you</i> will say I am making a rather narrow-minded fuss.
But I do hate publicity, and if it doesn't kill Robert outright,
it will have some shattering effect upon his character
and his health. Really, I am not thinking so much of
myself. Your own <i>reckless</i> bravery, however, would quail
a little, I fancy, at the idea of having your most intimate
feelings called out from the housetops and discussed in
the streets. And remember, please, that Robert is a
dreamer&mdash;a poet. Of course, in every <i>active</i> expedition
there must be some few idealistic, Quixotic souls who have
to suffer vicariously for the rest. He is such an one.
But that sort of feeling of soreness which comes from the
sense of martyrdom is not quite the same as a raw wound
on one's own <i>personal</i> score. I do hope I am clear. I
try to look on the bright side, but there are days when
the unseen world and its glorious realities become dubious.
These are trials of faith, I know. If one could be wise,
one would keep silent at such times. Now, dearest Sara,
good-night.</p><p class="i8 nospaceabove">Yours ever lovingly,</p><p class="i12 nospaceabove"><span class="smcap">Pensée</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lord Garrow and Lady Sara left town the next day
for a short visit at Kemmerstone Park, the seat of
Arabella, Marchioness of Churleigh. Lady Churleigh
had a favourite nephew for whom she was extremely
anxious &#8220;to do something.&#8221; Vague by nature, she
had never been able to define her ambition in more
precise terms, but, as she entertained influential people
only, it was considered, in many circles, that she over-did
her civilities toward the mammon of unrighteousness.
Those who were not invited called her heartless;
those who accepted her hospitality found fault
with her brains. All praised her cook, and no one
ever thought of her nephew. It was known that she
could not leave him her money. Every pair of eyes
read his name&mdash;Lord Douglas Hendlesham&mdash;on his
bedroom door at the top of the grand staircase, and
visitors soon learnt to associate this advertisement with
a pale, haughty young man who appeared occasionally
at meals, or sometimes listened disdainfully to the
music after dinner in the saloon. Distinguished
persons, staying at Kemmerstone for the first time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>would ask a fellow-guest, &#8220;Who is the melancholy
youth who looks so ill?&#8221; &#8220;That,&#8221; they would be
told, &#8220;is Douglas Hendlesham, I <i>think</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Disraeli called him &#8220;a personified hallucination.&#8221;</p>

<p>The party, on this particular occasion, consisted of
Agnes Carillon (who attracted unusual attention as
the <i>fiancée</i> of Lord Reckage), the Bishop of Hadley
(her father), the Duke and Duchess of Pevensey,
Charles Aumerle, and Mr. Disraeli. Lord Garrow
lost no time in conveying his version of the Orange
scandal to the ex-Minister's ears. It was a damp afternoon,
and the two gentlemen marched up and down
the smoking-room together, talking so earnestly that
the Duke (to his rage) dared not interrupt them, and
drove out instead with his Duchess and Lady Churleigh&mdash;who
bored him beyond sleep. Disraeli had been
opposed, from the first, to Robert's marriage with
Mrs. Parflete, for, as other diplomatists, he preferred
his own plans before those of Providence, and he had
wished to see his young friend wisely united to the
unexceptionable Viscountess Fitz Rewes.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; he observed, shrugging his shoulders, &#8220;to
talk expediency is not a safe way of opening the game
with Orange. Many men have ability, few have
genius, but fewer still have character. Orange has a
rectangular will and an indomitable character. <i>Character</i>
is the rarest thing in England.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Garrow stiffened his back.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been educated in a contrary belief,&#8221; said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>he. &#8220;Our national character is our dearest possession.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is because it is so rare. You mistake your
education for your experience&mdash;a common error. By
character I mean that remnant of a man's life which
is probably stronger than death, and ought to be
stronger than worldly considerations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Far be it from me to go into such subtleties,&#8221;
returned his lordship, stealing a glance at Disraeli's
powerful face. &#8220;Your friend, at all events, has done
for himself now. His merits seem to be more interesting
than respectable, and this marriage has furnished
conversation for the whole town&mdash;chiefly because
Beauclerk Reckage was his best man. One cannot
help feeling sorry for him, but it is certainly a very
bad thing. How will he justify his rash conduct?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He may think it unwise to be detailed in self-justification.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is all well enough, and so far I am with you.
In such circumstances, one doesn't want to tell a lie,
and yet one doesn't want to tell the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, there are many duties and difficulties in
life: there is but one obligation&mdash;courage.&#8221;</p>

<p>He fixed his eyes on the fire blazing in the grate,
and repeated the word with great emphasis&mdash;&#8220;Courage!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will need it. An unpleasant suggestion has
been put forward by the lawyers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Divorce?&#8221; said Disraeli.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A Bishop was telling me the other day that
when one attacks the principle of divorce one forgets
that it was originally a Divine institution! But
I agree with you&mdash;it is unpleasant. You will find that
Orange won't hear of such a course. I see great
dangers ahead for him, but I see no honourable way of
avoiding them. When a man, careless of danger, unconcerned
with profit, takes up the cause of God
against the world, others may not follow, but they
must admire him. Abstract sentiments of virtue do
not charm me. Orange is a Roman Catholic, however,
and therefore a practical idealist. The practical
idealists of England are the Dissenters&mdash;mostly the
Methodists. John Wesley was considered crack-brained
by his contemporaries at Oxford; he was a
greater mystic, in several ways, than Newman, but he
was not such a poet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know nothing about Dissenters and that class.
As for the Catholics&mdash;the few I am acquainted with
are civil and sensible.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true. Most of the English Catholics
imagine that St. Peter's and the Vatican can be maintained
on the policy of a parish church in Mayfair!
But one moment. There is Aumerle in the hall with
a telegram. I wonder if he has any fresh news about
poor Derby.&#8221;<i>[Lord Derby was then lying at the point of death.]</i></p>

<p>With this unimpeachable excuse he left his noble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>companion, who, more certain than ever that Disraeli
could never be in touch with the upper classes of
England, retired to his own room and wrote down in
a journal all he could remember of their conversation.</p>

<p>Lady Sara, meanwhile, had invited Agnes Carillon
to walk through the famous gardens of Kemmerstone,
and, as each girl was anxious to study the other, they
started on the expedition in that high pitch of nervous
excitement and generous animosity which one may
detect in splendid rivals, or even in formal allies.
Sara dressed more richly than was the fashion at that
time among English unmarried ladies. Her furs,
velvets, laces and jewels were referred to an Asiatic,
barbaric love of display. Agnes, therefore, who had
attired herself, in protest, even more plainly than
usual, was a little taken aback to find her remarkable
acquaintance in brown cashmere, a cloth jacket, and a
severe felt hat of the Tyrolean shape, which, poised
upon her chignon, tilted far over her fine blue eyes.
Both women, however, were so young and handsome
that even the trying fashions of the period could not
destroy their brilliant appearance. The chagrin of the
one and the ironical triumph of the other soon gave
way to more generous feelings. Each took her companion's
measure with a swift, intelligent, respectful
glance.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall we need umbrellas?&#8221; said Agnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have nothing on that will spoil,&#8221; replied Sara,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>&#8220;but I am a little anxious about your shoes. Are
they thick enough?&#8221;</p>

<p>Miss Carillon was above many vanities; she left
her facial beauty to take care of itself. But her feet
were uncommonly well moulded, and she was careful
not to disguise them in the hideous porpoise-hide
boots with flat soles and no instep which found favour
with her generation.</p>

<p>&#8220;They look very nice,&#8221; continued Sara, &#8220;and I
really think they are worth a slight cold. Take my
arm, for then we can walk better. How nobly Lord
Reckage has behaved in this dreadful affair of Robert
Orange! You won't think me strange for introducing
the subject at once? It must be on both our minds,
for you are naturally thinking of Reckage, and I am
thinking of dear Pensée.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beauclerk is very fond of Mr. Orange.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He must be. Do notice the autumn tint on those
beech-trees. How I envy artists&mdash;although it is not
their business to contend with Nature. The great
vice of the present day is <i>bravura</i>&mdash;an attempt to do
something beyond the truth. That reminds me&mdash;how
does the portrait grow? David Rennes is extremely
clever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beauclerk admires his work. He considers him
finer than Millais.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What does he think of the portrait?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He hasn't seen it yet. My people are much
pleased with the likeness. I find it flattering.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed!&#8221; said Sara thoughtfully. &#8220;Did you
give him many sittings?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He knows my face pretty well. We are acquaintances
of some years' standing. Papa has a high
opinion of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am no judge. Women can know so little about
men.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't agree with you there. They are far more
conventional than we are. They are trained in
batches, thousands are of one pattern&mdash;especially in
society. But each woman has an individual bringing-up.
She is influenced by a foreign governess, or
her mother, or her nurse. This must give every girl
peculiar personal views of everything. That is why
men find us hard to understand. We don't understand
each other; we suspect each other: we have
no sense of comradeship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you are right,&#8221; said Agnes, rather sadly.
&#8220;Yet our troubles all seem to arise from the fact that
we cannot manage men. It matters very little really
whether we can manage women. With women,
one need only be natural, straightforward, and unselfish.
You can't come to grief that way. But with
men, it is almost impossible to be quite natural. As
for being straightforward, don't they misconstrue our
words continually? And when one tries to be unselfish,
they accuse one of hardness, coldness, and
everything most contrary to one's feelings. Of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>course,&#8221; she added quickly, &#8220;I speak from observation.
I have nothing to complain of myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course not. Neither have I. I have grown
up with most of my men friends. I had no mother,
and I exhausted dozens of governesses and masters,
I am sure I was troublesome, but I had an instinctive
horror of becoming narrow-minded and getting into a
groove. My English relations bored me. My foreign
ones made my dear papa jealous and uncomfortable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you liked them?&#8221; said Agnes at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;Enormously. You see, I am always an alien
among English people.&#8221;</p>

<p>Agnes, following an instinct of kindness, pressed
her arm and murmured, &#8220;No, no.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my dear, yes. And this is why I am
devoted to Mr. Disraeli, and so much interested in
Robert Orange. We three are citizens of the
world.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But English people who have lived, for any length
of time, abroad are quite as sensible and tolerant
as you are. Take Mr. Rennes, of whom we are
just speaking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To be sure. But artists and poets are like stars&mdash;they
belong to no land. A strictly national painter
or a strictly national poet is bound to be parochial&mdash;a
kind of village pump. And you may write inscriptions
all over him, and build monuments above
him, but he remains a pump by a local spring.
David Rennes is a genius.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad you think so,&#8221; said Agnes, with
flushing cheeks. &#8220;I wonder whether he will ever be
an Academician?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you feel more sure of his gifts&mdash;in that
case?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a slight note of sarcasm in the question.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is stupid of me, I know,&#8221; said Agnes frankly,
&#8220;but one can't help feeling rather shy until one's
opinions are officially endorsed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How British!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it is my bringing-up. It sounds very
feeble. I often feel that if I once began&mdash;really
began&mdash;to think for myself I wouldn't stick at anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is British, too,&#8221; said Sara, laughing. &#8220;You
are a true <i>Jane</i> Bull! But as you are going to marry
a public man, that is as well. Your life will have
many absorbing interests.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes,&#8221; returned Agnes; &#8220;I hope to help
Beauclerk in his constituency, and with the members
of his Association.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So far as I can make out they are a weak, selfish
lot, but these qualities do not affect the question of his
duties toward them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You express, better than I could, my own
feeling. I fear they don't always appreciate his
motives.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beauclerk,&#8221; said Sara slowly, &#8220;is impulsive. He
is never afraid of changing his mind. Many people
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>are called firm merely because they haven't the moral
courage to own their second thoughts.&#8221;</p>

<p>Agnes drew a long sigh, slackened her pace, and
stood looking at the strange, autumnal lights in the
sky, the martins flying over the paddocks toward the
wood, and the crescent moon which already shone out
above them.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose it does mean lack of courage, half the
time,&#8221; she said at last; &#8220;and yet how disastrous it
is to wonder about the wisdom of any decision once
arrived at, of any step once taken! I daresay every
one shrinks a little at first from the responsibility of
undertaking another person's happiness.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not every one,&#8221; replied Sara; &#8220;the generous
ones only.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have known Beauclerk ever since he was a
boy, haven't you?&#8221; asked Agnes.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. He was such a handsome lad, and he has
always been the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am devoted to him,&#8221; said Agnes. &#8220;I am proud
to think that he has chosen me for his wife. But
one thought is perpetually coming up in my mind:
Shall I be able to make him happy? A girl, as a rule,
seems to believe that she can make a man happy
merely by loving him. Again and again friends of
mine have married in this idea. And the hope
seldom answers.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke very quietly, yet there was great feeling,
even great bitterness in her tone. She was thinking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>of David Rennes. Sara had a curious magnetism
which attracted all those with whom she came into
friendly relations. Being imaginative, though never
inquisitive, her quick sympathies rendered the most
trivial interchange of ideas an emotional exercise.
This power, which would have made her a successful
actress, found its usual outlet in her pianoforte
playing, which affected her hearers as only
extraordinary nervous and passionate force can affect
people. She had neither the patience nor the
sternness of mental quality which is required in a
creative genius: the little songs and poems which
she sometimes composed were insipid to an astonishing
degree. Hers were the executant's gifts,
and the fascination which she exerted over men and
women depended wholly on the natural charm of a
temperament made up of fire and honey. Agnes
had always regarded Lady Sara as an odd but chivalrous
girl. The stories told in society about her
eccentric tastes, sayings, and doings were never to her
heart's discredit, no matter how much they puzzled, or
dismayed, the conventional set into which she had
been born. It was felt that she could be trusted, and,
although many were afraid of her brains, no one had
ever known her to betray a confidence, to injure
another woman's reputation, to show the least spite,
or to insist upon an undue share of men's attention.
The sex may, and do, pardon the first three sins, but the
last has yet to find its atoning virtue. All declared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>that Sara, with many shortcomings, was neither a
poacher nor a grabber. Girls consulted her in their
love troubles, and not a few owed their marriages to
her wise arbitration. She had the gypsy's spell.
Thus it happened, therefore, that Agnes, who was
habitually reserved, found herself thinking aloud in
the presence of this mysterious but not hostile
personality.</p>

<p>&#8220;When does Beauclerk return from the North of
France?&#8221; asked Sara.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is coming back with Mr. Orange next
Wednesday. I had a letter this morning.&#8221; Her
voice grew husky, and with evident agitation she
halted once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know Beauclerk so well,&#8221; she said at last,
&#8220;that I want to ask you something, and you must
answer me truly&mdash;without the least dread of giving
offence&mdash;because a great deal may depend on what
you tell me. Do you think he seems altogether
settled in his mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sara guessed, from the nature of the question,
that the truth in this case would be a relief&mdash;not a
blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;He doesn't seem quite himself&mdash;if you understand
me,&#8221; she said, without hesitation.</p>

<p>Agnes caught her arm a little more closely and
walked with a lighter step.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't think we love each other sufficiently for
marriage,&#8221; she exclaimed; &#8220;his last letter was so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>affectionate and so full of kindness that it brought
tears to my eyes. I saw the effort under it all. We
are making a tragic mistake. We drifted into it.
We were such good friends, and we felt, I daresay,
that it was our duty to love each other. His family
were pleased and so were mine. We seem to have
pleased everybody except ourselves. Not that I ever
expected the joy and stuff, and inward feelings which
one reads of. I am too sensible for that. But I wanted
to feel <i>established</i>&mdash;whereas we are both, in reality,
rather upset. I am sure of this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps when you see each other&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;Our letters are far more satisfactory than our
meetings. I know he is fond of me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You couldn't doubt that. It is worship.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can say, at any rate, that I am so sure of his
affection that it gives me no pain&mdash;not the least&mdash;to
miss the&mdash;the other quality.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, you are not in love with him, or you
couldn't be so resigned.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you are right. I have never told him
that I loved him. He has never asked me. Perhaps
he took it for granted. As for me, I thought that
the respect and esteem I felt would do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sara shook her head.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for us. We are different, I know, but we
have hearts. We can suffer, we can endure, we can
be resigned, we can be everything except uncertain,
or luke-warm. Isn't that true?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Agnes, and she laughed a little. &#8220;It
isn't my way,&#8221; she went on, &#8220;to talk like this about
myself. Yet I can't help seeing that all this keeping
silence, and disguising facts from one's own reason,
is actually weak. I don't want to be weak. It isn't
English. I don't want to be supine. That isn't
English either. I want to be just and square all round&mdash;in
my dealings with others and in my dealings with
my own conscience. Papa has always taught us
a great deal about individual liberty, and freedom
of will. I am beginning to wonder what liberty
means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's the first step toward a great change.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young girl set her lips, and looked steadfastly
before her, as though she would pierce the gathering
twilight with her bright and candid eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I daresay you are right. Anyhow, our talk has
been a help. When I may seem to lack courage, it
is because I lack conviction. Once convinced, I can
depend upon myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;When did these ideas come to you?&#8221; asked
Sara.</p>

<p>&#8220;They have been coming for some time. I have
been abroad a good deal, and I have been meeting
people who make opinions. I never gave in when I
was with them, but I must have been influenced.&#8221;</p>

<p>The slight emphasis on the words <i>people</i> and <i>them</i>
was too studied to escape Sara's trained hearing. She
knew the force of a woman's rhetorical plural.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I believe you have your convictions now, at this
moment,&#8221; she said quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No&mdash;not in the final shape.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you can predict the final shape?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One more day and then I will decide irrevocably.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you hesitate?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For this reason&mdash;I must grieve papa and disappoint
my mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Still, both these things have to be done. Some of
the best men have been obliged to displease their
parents in choosing a vocation. Women, in their
marriages, are often driven to the same sad straits.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, but the prospect is most painful. I feel
I could bear my own disappointment far better than
I could bear theirs. Surely you understand?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Too well.&#8221;</p>

<p>They had now reached the house, and Agnes's
habitual manner at once re-asserted itself. Her voice,
which had many rich notes, fell into the one unchanging
tone she used in ordinary conversation.
Her countenance seemed as placid as a pink geranium
under glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you for a very pleasant walk,&#8221; she said to
Sara. &#8220;I sha'n't forget it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor I. And, please, after this, always call me
Sara. And may I call you Agnes? We have just
time now to write a few letters before dinner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XV" id="CHAPTER_XV"></a>CHAPTER XV</h2>


<p>Robert, accompanied by Lord Reckage, arrived in
London the following Wednesday. Pensée and Brigit
went from St. Malo to Paris, where the unhappy girl
hoped to enter the Conservatoire. All had been
arranged by Robert himself, and he had shown a
calmness during the ordeal which might have deceived
his two friends had they been even a little insincere
themselves or a shade less fond. His Journal at that
period contains two entries, however, which show that
neither Lady Fitz Rewes nor Reckage were wrong in
fearing he had received a mortal blow which no earthly
influence could make endurable.</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Oct., 1869.</i>&mdash;I am once more at Almouth House.
Beauclerk's consideration for me is almost more than I can
bear. The rest is not borne. If it were not cowardly, I
would go away alone, and brood at my leisure and yield to
the appalling yet all but irresistible wretchedness which
calls me, which I actually crave. An effort not to depress
or discourage others may be right and my duty. I cannot
be sure of this. Sometimes I feel as though it would be
wiser to meet the dark hours and make acquaintance
with them.... And what is to become of her? The
longing to see her&mdash;even in the distance....</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>
<p>To-night I talked with Reckage about his Bond of
Association. Most of the members feel toward him that
insipid kind of hatred which passes for friendship in public
life. If he were naturally observant, he would see this;
if he were given at all to self-doubt, he would feel it.
But his way is to regard most men as ill-mannered and
well-meaning.</p>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;Another day. I begin to see that I have
been called to make every sacrifice&mdash;marriage, ambition,
happiness, all must be abandoned: abandoned while I live,
not after I have made myself, by years of self-discipline,
indifferent to such considerations.... But for its piety,
the <i>Imitation</i> is, I think, the most pessimistic book in the
world. The <i>Exercises</i> of St. Ignatius (perhaps because he
was a saint) produce quite an opposite effect upon me;
they exhort us to hope, action, courage. They make one
a citizen of both worlds. Merely to read him is a campaign
in the open air against a worthy foe. I defy any
man to go through the <i>Exercises</i> with his whole heart, and
even whine again. I have resolved to write willingly no
more, to speak willingly no more, on the subject of my
marriage. That page is turned for ever: there shall be no
glancing back. Moods inevitably must come; spasms of
despair are as little tractable as spasms of physical pain.
But I can at least keep silent about their true cause. The
first step toward the cure of egoism is to lock away one's
Journal. I shall add no more to this till I have mastered
my present state. And I wonder what that mastery will
mean? Are some victories better lost?</p></blockquote>

<p>The Journal ends abruptly at this point, and no
more was added that year. His letter to Lord Wight
has been preserved because his lordship sent it to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>Pensée in some anger, begging her to explain such
callousness. Pensée, being a woman, brought a
gentler understanding to the inquiry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't you see,&#8221; she said, &#8220;that his heart is
broken?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see,&#8221; returned his lordship drily, &#8220;he is a born
R. C. ecclesiastic. Religious instinct is the ruling
passion of Orange. That poor young woman&mdash;with
whom he is madly in love&mdash;was merely an accident of
his career. She has affected his character&mdash;yes. I
suppose Cardinal Manning's wife had her influence in
her day. But Robert will work better than ever after
this. Whereas look at me, my dear. When I lost
Sybil, I was completely done for. I tried to set up for
myself, but I couldn't. I hope I am a Christian; God
forbid that I should quarrel with His will. Yet I
cannot think I am a better man for my poor darling's
death. Don't talk to me. Don't say anything.&#8221;</p>

<p>The letter in question ran as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="i20"><span class="smcap">Almouth House</span>.</p><p class="nospaceabove"><span class="smcap">My dear Lord Wight</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>The messages which you have sent by Lady Fitz Rewes
have helped me where I most needed assistance. When I
tell you this, it would be more possible for you to imagine
my gratitude than for me to express it&mdash;at least, in words,
and for that matter I can't see how any act of mine could
prove even a fraction of it. Shall I resume my work on
the 28th? I have had to learn that one does not always
choose one's vocation. It is sometimes chosen for us. May
I beg you, as one more favour, never to talk to me about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>the events of the last fortnight? In one sense I am able&mdash;too
able&mdash;to discuss them. This is why I must not indulge
myself. In times to come I may find it, perhaps, a certain
effort to speak of it all. Then I will tell you gladly anything
your kindness may seek to know. But just now it is
my duty to keep silent. One cannot fight the wild beasts,
and describe them fairly, at the same hour. Either they
seem more formidable than they are, or they are even more
terrible than they seem. But the order has gone forth&mdash;&#8220;Face
them.&#8221;</p><p class="i8 nospaceabove">Your affectionate and grateful,</p><p class="i12 nospaceabove"><span class="smcap">Robert</span> de <span class="smcap">H. Orange</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>Robert himself, after he had written this final letter,
decided to reply in person to a note which he had
received that morning from Lady Sara. He walked to
St. James's Square wondering, without much interest,
whether Fate would have her absent or at home.
As a matter of fact, she had felt a presentiment of his
call, and he found her, beautifully dressed in violet tints,
copying some Mass music in the drawing-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hoped you would come,&#8221; she said, when the
servant had closed the door. &#8220;Nothing else could
have shown me that you didn't mind my writing. I
had to write. I wrote badly, but indeed I understood.
It takes an eternity to sound the infinite. We won't
talk of you: we can talk about other people. Ask
me what I have been doing.&#8221;</p>

<p>All this time she held his hand, but in such sisterly,
kind fashion, that he felt more at ease with her than
it was ever possible to be with Pensée, who was timid,
and therefore disturbing.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Have you accepted Marshire?&#8221; he asked at
once.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; she said, blushing; &#8220;I do not love him
sufficiently to marry him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know that I always fly from important
mediocrities. You think that sounds heartless. He
has been so kind to me. But I love as I must&mdash;not
as I ought. My dear friend, all the trouble in life is
due to forced affection. Look at Beauclerk! Think
of Agnes Carillon! What fiery fierceness of sorrow
in both their hearts! Papa and I were at Lady Churleigh's
last Sunday. Agnes was there, looking, believe
me, lovely. No portrait does her justice. One finds
marvellous beauty, now and again, in the middle
classes. She is an exquisite <i>bourgeoise</i>. She is not
clever enough to feel bored; she is too well brought up
to be fascinating; too handsome to insist on homage.
Plain women are exacting and capricious&mdash;they make
themselves <i>worth while</i>. <i>Il faut se faire valoir!</i> That
is why a man will often adore an ugly woman for ever,
whereas an Agnes&mdash;an Agnes&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>She paused, gave him a glance, and laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Beauclerk adore Agnes?&#8221; said she.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can one man judge another in these questions?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If neither are hypocrites&mdash;yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As for conscious hypocrisy, a priest of great experience
once told me that in twenty years he had met
but one deliberate hypocrite. You must be less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>cynical. Men, however, don't watch each other
closely as a rule in sentimental matters.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If that is a reproof, I thank you for it,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;It may do me good. This wayward soul
of mine is all wrong. Be patient with me. I can't
help thinking that most men living are, at the bottom,
wholly selfish and truly miserable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very few people are truly miserable. If this were
not the case, the world and all creatures must have
perished long ago.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I can tell you of three wretches at any
rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Three&mdash;against the world and all the planets and
heaven?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. They are Beauclerk, and Agnes and I.
We want time and space annihilated in order that we
may be happy. We must be humorous studies to
those looking on, but we are, nevertheless, utterly
desperate. This is true. Scold me now&mdash;if you can.
Tell me what is to become of us&mdash;if you dare.&#8221;</p>

<p>She stood up. She clenched her small hands, set
her lips, and grew so pale that the pearls around her
neck seemed dark.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me what is to become of us&mdash;if you dare,&#8221;
she repeated, &#8220;because mischief is certain. You
belong to those who endure and fight good fights,
and keep the faith. Beauclerk and I are of another
order altogether. We suffer without endurance, we
fight without winning, and the little faith we have is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>so little that it is taken away from us. As for Agnes&mdash;wait!
She is encased, at present, in conventionalities.
But she is gradually getting rid of these wrappings
and trappings. She will surprise you all yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can believe that. She is a woman, and a good
one. All the surprising, inconceivable things are done
by good women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And most of the wicked things, too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Possibly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me tell you then that, if it is possible in the
circumstances, Agnes ought to give Beauclerk his
release. It would be no more than his right to
demand this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A right is something independent of circumstances,
and paramount to them. But when you once talk
of your rights and your wrongs in love, all love is
gone, or going. I hope it hasn't come to that&mdash;with
Reckage!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have great knowledge of him and know how
to press it home when you choose. Can't you see,
plainly enough, that he is on the road to disaster?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No. One may easily be a long way from happiness
and still be nowhere near disaster,&#8221; he said,
checking a deep sigh. &#8220;Of course, if he feels that
he cannot in honour remain in his present situation,
he must act at once. Men who are desirous to satisfy
all their friends soon become irresolute on every occasion.
That is all I shall say upon the subject, and
this, perhaps, may be saying more than I ought.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Another reproof! So be it. But I am thinking
of his contentment, and you are thinking of his duty.
What is duty? It generally means that which your
acquaintances&mdash;for no reason and without warrant&mdash;expect
of you. I take a larger view.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;People of Beauclerk's stamp are so constituted
that they can rarely find contentment by defying a
general opinion.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Agnes is not a pretty, crying, fluttering
creature who would excite compassion. Who, for
instance, could jilt Pensée? I don't wish Beauclerk
to jilt anybody, however. I want Agnes to take the
step.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because he will break his heart and die&mdash;if she
doesn't. There!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then it will be your fault.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Orange!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know it, and I mean it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled at him and shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you think I would ever take the commonplace
course?&#8221; she said proudly. &#8220;I did hope that
you could appreciate motives for which the world at
large is slow enough to give credit. Beauclerk is
weak, attractive, and in perplexity; I search my heart
again and again, and I find nothing but friendship there&mdash;for
him. I am careful of every word I speak, and
every look, and every thought. My interest is
unselfish. But,&#8221; she added, &#8220;what can any of us
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>do, after all, toward raising either dead bodies or
dead souls?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dead souls?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. Beauclerk might have been something
once; he is still very clever; he will soon be a man
for occasional addresses. I believe in him, you see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that.&#8221;</p>

<p>She was smiling, yet almost in tears, and her voice
trembled. He wished to speak, if only to break the
sudden, oppressive silence which followed her last
words; but neither of them could find a thought to
offer. They sat facing each other, lost in following
out unutterable conjectures, fancies, and doubts, each
painfully aware of a certain mystery, each filled with
a sure premonition of troubles to come.</p>

<p>&#8220;I could almost pray,&#8221; she exclaimed at last, &#8220;that
you didn't trust him. Because&mdash;in spite of himself&mdash;he
must disappoint every one. He is not a deliberate
traitor&mdash;but a born one.&#8221;</p>

<p>As Sara spoke the double doors were thrown open.</p>

<p>Lord Reckage was announced.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beauclerk!&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>His lordship, self-absorbed, did not perceive her
confusion&mdash;which she was too young to dissemble
perfectly.</p>

<p>&#8220;The man told me that you were here,&#8221; he said,
addressing Orange and seating himself by Sara. &#8220;I
call this luck&mdash;finding you both together. I have
just been with my Committee. They always expect
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>the worst of me now, and they are always cheerful in
the expectation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sara began to disentangle some silk fringe on her
skirt; she did not look up, and she offered no comment.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is the matter now?&#8221; asked Robert.</p>

<p>&#8220;They want to get rid of me. You see, one might
practise very considerably on the credulity of the
members if one chose, and these fellows on the
Executive wish me to take a cautious line with regard
to Dr. Temple's nomination.<i>[Mr. Gladstone's nomination of Dr. Temple to the See of Exeter.]</i> It is all very well for
Pusey to write, &#8216;Do you prefer your party to Almighty
God and to the souls of men?&#8217; But, as Aumerle says,
Pusey is not in the House of Commons. An attack on
Temple will be highly unpopular. We have sounded
opinion in various quarters, and we receive the
unanimous reply&mdash;&#8216;Have nothing to do with it.&#8217;
There is a feeling in the clubs, too, that vapid, colourless
orthodoxy is not wanted in England. Healthy
disagreement within limits suits us. The question is,
then: Ought I to go against this strong tide and
get myself disliked?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Sara at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Beyond a doubt.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said his lordship, readily enough, &#8220;a
combination in defence of any article of the faith is
a noble thing. My original idea was to get up a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>combination of High and Low and Broad Churchmen,
and make a stand on purely legal grounds. For
instance, how can the bishops, <i>without previous
explanation</i>, consecrate one lying under the censure
of their House? That is all. There is nothing
offensive in that. We merely ask for an explanation:
we offer no judgment: we state no prejudice. If Dr.
Temple intends to withdraw his paper from <i>Essays and
Reviews</i>&mdash;well and good. Personally, he bears the
highest character. He would be, in many ways, an
acquisition to the Church. But does he himself
believe in the Church as a Divine institution&mdash;mark
you, a <i>Divine</i> institution? Neither the <i>Outs</i> nor the
<i>Ins</i>, I should think, could object to this question.
Aumerle and the Executive, however, are dead against
any proceedings at all. They think we ought to give
our Association a more secular character. They say
we are hampered by too vehement a religious tone.
They say that broad Christian principles are more
workable. Besides, the word Christian always attracts
the Nonconformists in spite of themselves. They are
bound to support you if you stick to the line of a
believer in Christ&mdash;irrespective of particular doctrines.
And so on and so on. I prefer something more hard
and fast myself. Yet they may be right. One must
go with the times.&#8221;</p>

<p>He shifted his chair several times during this speech,
looking first at Orange and then at Sara for encouragement.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Your Executive are poor creatures,&#8221; said Sara,
with a curling lip; &#8220;your weak theologians have
become flabby politicians&mdash;their one rule of action
is to avoid everything which demands even the
possibility of self-sacrifice or adverse criticism.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is most unfair,&#8221; said Reckage hotly. &#8220;One
must see where one is going.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The world,&#8221; said Sara, &#8220;in the long run, despises
those who pander to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but it is in the <i>long</i> run, and no mistake!
What a fellow you are, Robert! Why don't
you suggest something? Are you trying to find the
civilest thing you can say of the performance?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the system which you must attack in the
present difficulty. The system is at fault&mdash;not Dr.
Temple,&#8221; said Robert.</p>

<p>&#8220;No other system can be now looked to as a
substitute,&#8221; answered Reckage impatiently. &#8220;The
thing cannot be done away now, the danger is too near.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Exactly. The English can never deal with
systems or ideas. They can only attack individuals&mdash;you
depend in a crisis on the passions of men, never
on their reason. Whereas if you overhauled their
reason, worked it, and trained it, the passions, at the
critical moment, would be roused with better effect,
and would be properly organised. Organised passions
are what you need for a strong public movement.
Whirling emotions in contrary currents are utterly
futile.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I daresay. I hoped we might make such efforts
as to fix a lasting impression on both Houses that the
State appointment of bishops, coupled with the farce
of a <i>congé d'élire</i>, is rank blasphemy. This outrage on
good taste ought to occupy the attention of every
man. It is quite enough to fill the minds of all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won't,&#8221; said Robert. &#8220;You must remember
that whatever strikes the mind of an average man,
as the result of his own observation and discovery,
makes always the strongest impression upon him.
Now the average man is not engaged in studying
Church government. He will not thank you for
calling his attention to it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then what do you want Beauclerk to do?&#8221;
asked Sara.</p>

<p>&#8220;He must fight just the same, of course. I merely
wish him to see what he has to encounter. By
dragging the clergy into the movement you make
it savour&mdash;to the popular intelligence&mdash;of professional
jealousy. By making Dr. Temple your example,
you render those who respect his character powerless
to express their opinion. Given the system, he is
unquestionably the fittest man to profit by it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reckage took many turns round the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;The personal character of Dean Ethbin,&#8221; he said,
at last, &#8220;is not exactly square. He acts a trimming part.
But now and again he sums up a situation. He says
that the English people do not choose to keep up an
Established Church which shall be independent of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>Sovereign and Legislature. I have seen most of the
bishops and archdeacons. They are against Temple;
they say very little about the system. Even men
with nothing to gain by it,&#8221; he added, ingenuously,
&#8220;don't appear to criticise it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For all that, the Church must deliver her conscience
at whatever risk. She ought to assert her will&mdash;even
against her interest&mdash;in order to show England
that she is her own mistress!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You mean that ironically! What does for Rome,
however, doesn't do for us. The Church of England
is It&mdash;not She&mdash;to most people. As for Rome,
nothing in her belongs to humanity, except the
Vatican discipline&mdash;the life of which, I confess, is a
permanent miracle!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My best friends,&#8221; entreated Sara gaily, &#8220;do not&mdash;do
not fight. Be nice to each other and listen to me.
The English never read history. Why not get up a
kind of Historical Commission and examine the validity
of the Anglican Orders? There you can work at the
roots of things. After that, introduce a Bill for the
admission of clergymen to Parliament. You have
spiritual peers, why not spiritual Commons?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One at a time,&#8221; said Reckage; &#8220;what ideas you
have! Say them again. I believe they are not half
bad. But do go more slowly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sara, with a becoming instinct of meekness, took her
favourite seat on the fender, and at the feet of the two
men, looking up humbly, began to explain herself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>with that lightness of phrase only possible to those
who have a profound knowledge of their subject. Her
submissive attitude, her soft, musical voice, and her
docile expression made both men insensible to the
actual commands insinuated into the emotional wit
and acute arguments of her little speech. Reckage
was fascinated. He sat there drinking in her beauty
and wisdom&mdash;the one stimulated his senses, the other
pierced his intelligence, making him feel that, with
such a companion ever by his side, he might achieve
heroism with a good conscience. As matters were,
he was often dissatisfied, sleepless, and oppressed&mdash;particularly
under praise. He was not often set right,
as he would have said it, in his own opinion&mdash;even
when the world and his Executive Committee were
disposed to cry out&mdash;&#8220;Well done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I didn't run within pounds of my form,&#8221; was the
cry of self-reproach he invariably heard above the
applause of his colleagues or the commendation of
the Press. Sara, he believed, would give him the
courage of his own better nature. These thoughts
were passing rosily in his heart, when Lord Garrow,
accompanied by Agnes Carillon, entered the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;My love,&#8221; said Lord Garrow to Sara, &#8220;I met Miss
Carillon on the steps of the London Library, and I have
brought her in to tea. But why do you sit in the
firelight? Why haven't they lit the gas? And who
is here?&#8221;</p>

<p>A sudden flame from the grate illuminated the faces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>of Orange and Lord Reckage. The two ladies
greeted each other. All spoke, and then all were
silent. It was an awkward meeting for every one
present. Lord Garrow rang the bell, and the small
company sat there without a word, watching the
footman light the gas in the glass chandelier.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you suppose we have been talking
about?&#8221; asked Sara desperately.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can't imagine, my dear,&#8221; said her father. &#8220;I am
far too cross. I hate these odd ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were discussing the validity of Anglican
Orders.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;God bless my soul!&#8221; exclaimed his lordship;
&#8220;what next?&#8221;</p>

<p>Agnes, who was looking pale and worried, frowned
with displeasure.</p>

<p>&#8220;But how disloyal!&#8221; she said severely. &#8220;As if one
could even discuss such a question!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Orange is a Roman Catholic,&#8221; answered Sara,
&#8220;so he is not disloyal. I am nothing&mdash;so I have no
obligations. Lord Reckage is in public life and has
to meet the problems of the age. Don't be narrow,
dear Agnes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think it too bad, all the same,&#8221; replied Miss
Carillon&mdash;&#8220;even in fun. I am sure I am right.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Reckage tried to conceal his annoyance, but
his voice shook a little as he said&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;We were not joking. New men will come in,
not improbably with new ideas. I must be ready for
them. An ignorance of men's moods is fatal.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>He hoped she would take this warning to herself.
She was, however, too stirred to consider anything
except the cause of their common agitation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dr. Benson was saying to papa only last week,&#8221;
she answered, &#8220;that there is no apparent recognition
of the Divine presence in our daily affairs. It is most
shocking.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The clergy are doing their level best, by bigotry,
to make Benson's assertion true. At any rate, I am
not going about, as the French put it, with my paws
in the air. I feel strongly tempted to throw up my
present line, and give the whole Association to the best
qualified hypocrite of my acquaintance.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The sure way out of that temptation is not to
think yourself exposed to it,&#8221; said Robert quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I hate sophistries,&#8221; said Agnes, tightening her
lips. &#8220;And I hope, Beauclerk, that you will never
remain in any painful situation against your will.&#8221;</p>

<p>These words seemed to bear an ominous significance.
Agnes herself, having uttered them, received
one of those sudden inward illuminations which, in
some natures, amount to second-sight. But she was
unimaginative and not especially observant, sensitive,
or skilled in discerning the signs of any psychological
disturbance. She felt only, on this occasion, that a
crisis had been reached, that Reckage was vexed with
himself, with her, with life generally. She had a
letter in her pocket from David Rennes&mdash;a beautiful,
touching letter, full of longing for a faith, a hope&mdash;love,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>he said, he possessed, alas! What a difference in the
two men!</p>

<p>&#8220;You don't understand,&#8221; said Sara. &#8220;You are
right because you haven't heard enough. Mr. Orange
is going to give a lecture on Church History, and
Lord Reckage has promised to be chairman. They
will hold the meeting at St. James's Hall, and I am
sure it will be most interesting. More I cannot tell
you, because they have gone no further in their plans.&#8221;</p>

<p>But misfortune had entered the room, and that
wayfarer&mdash;once admitted&mdash;asserts her ill-will without
let or hindrance. Agnes, barely touching her tea,
rose to say goodbye. Lord Garrow and Reckage
escorted her to the hall. They helped her into a
carriage (lent her for that afternoon by the Duchess of
Pevensey), and she drove away, trembling, tearful,
afraid, not reminding her <i>fiancé</i> that they were to
meet at dinner in the evening. He walked homeward,
but not until he had decided, after much hesitation,
that he could scarcely go back again to Lady Sara.
His thoughts were fixed now to one refrain&mdash;&#8220;I must
have my freedom.&#8221; Freedom, at that moment, had a
mocking, lovely face, the darkest blue eyes, and
quantities of long, black hair. She wore a violet dress,
her hands were white, and she talked like a Blue Book
set to music by Beethoven. Yes, he must have his
freedom and live.</p>

<p>Sara and Orange, meanwhile, left alone in the
drawing-room, were exchanging interrogatory glances,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>&#8220;What do you think now?&#8221; she asked; &#8220;do you
pretend to believe that Agnes and Beauclerk can make
each other even moderately contented?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you are to blame.&#8221;</p>

<p>A flush swept over her face. She looked bitter
reproaches, but she made no answer.</p>

<p>&#8220;And why are you so interested in Anglican
Orders?&#8221; he continued. &#8220;How is it that you know
your subject so well? For you do know it well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Catholic questions always appeal to me,&#8221; she said
coldly. &#8220;I have no religion, but I come from a race
of politicians and soldiers&mdash;on my mother's side. I
must have an intellectual <i>pied à terre</i>, and I require a
good cause. Party politics are too parochial for me.
So I am on the side of the Vatican.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>La reine s'amuse</i>,&#8221; said Robert. &#8220;Is that all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that's all.&#8221;</p>

<p>She turned over the music on her writing-table and
hummed some bars from the Kyrie of Mozart's
Twelfth Mass.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you were a Jesuit,&#8221; said she, &#8220;you would try to
convert me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;St. Ignatius never wasted time over insincere
women.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not insincere,&#8221; she said frankly. &#8220;I own I
may seem so. But you are not kind, and some day
you may be sorry for this.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her eyes filled with tears&mdash;which he noticed and
attributed to fatigue.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder how men ever accomplish anything!&#8221;
she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;They have no insight. They mistake self-control
for coldness, and despair for flippancy. Isn't that the
case?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One can be light and true as well as light and
false. Now you are witty, beautiful, brilliant&mdash;but
you don't always ring true.&#8221;</p>

<p>She seemed confused for a minute, and hung her
head.</p>

<p>&#8220;All the same,&#8221; she said, suddenly, &#8220;I am always
sincere with you. It is not in my power to be so
with every one. &#8216;Fate overrules my will.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is the trouble with most of us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then he wished her goodbye, promising, however,
to call again with regard to the Meeting. Lord
Garrow met him on the staircase.</p>

<p>&#8220;I congratulate you on your election to Brookes's,&#8221;
stammered his lordship, &#8220;but for Heaven's sake be
cautious at play. Really, the younger men there are
trying to revive the worst traditions in gaming. The
loo was rather high at Chetwynd's last night,&#8221; he
added, with a studied air of guilt. &#8220;I won £500
from my host. I call that the limit&mdash;even on old
Cabinet Steinberg!&#8221;</p>

<p>He smiled, he waved his hand, feeling that he had
displayed great taste in a situation of enormous difficulty.
Something unusual, too, in the young man's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>face touched his heart. It seemed to him that here
was one who had felt the world's buffets.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never been just in my estimate of Mr.
Orange,&#8221; said he to Sara, as he re-entered the drawing-room.
&#8220;I quite took to him to-day. He has a fine
countenance, and I am sure he is very much cut up
by this painful affair. It's a pity he's a Catholic, for
he would make such an excellent canon for St. Paul's.
He would <i>look</i> the part so well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Happiness, that nymph with unreturning feet,&#8217; has
passed him by,&#8221; said Sara, watching herself in one of
the mirrors.</p>

<p>&#8220;She has passed a good many,&#8221; sighed his lordship.
&#8220;But play me that lovely air which Titiens sings in
<i>Il Flauto Magico</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVI" id="CHAPTER_XVI"></a>CHAPTER XVI</h2>


<p>Agnes was too ill to appear at the Duchess of
Pevensey's dinner that evening. Lord Reckage's
melancholy, absent air during the entertainment, and
his early withdrawal from the distinguished party,
were referred, with sympathy, to the very proper
distress he felt at Miss Carillon's tiresome indisposition.
The time passed well enough for him&mdash;far better, in
fact, than he had expected, for he was relieved from
the strain of &#8220;dancing attendance&#8221; on his betrothed&mdash;a
thing which he, even more than most men, found
silly. In the chivalrous days of tournaments, troubadours
and crusades this romantic exercise of seeming
enslaved was, he held, justifiable, even interesting.
But in modern life it had an appearance of over-emphasis.</p>

<p>Poor Agnes, however, could neither eat, nor sleep,
nor rest. Her temples throbbed, her eyes ached;
every nerve was a barbed wire; her soul was manacled
by promises; she would not use her reason; the fever
in her veins was not to be quelled, and the one
agitating relief to her physical suffering was a constant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>perusal of David Rennes's letter. It was the first
passionate love-letter she had ever received. Just as
a river may stream peacefully through pastoral lands
till it joins the sea and becomes one with that vast
element of unrest, so the little flame of her girl's
nature was absorbed at last into the great fire underlying
all humanity. Was she in love? she asked
herself. When she was with Rennes she became
silent, incapable of conversation, of thought. All she
asked was to be near him, to watch him, to hear him.</p>

<p>Was this love? Was it love to press his letter
to her heart, to read it again and again, to keep
it under her pillow at night? Was it love to think
of him every moment of the day, to compare all
others to him and find them wanting, to see his
face always before her eyes? Was it love to know
that if he called her, as he called her now, she would
leave home, father, mother, friends, all things, all
people, and follow him to the world's end, to the
beginning of hell, or&mdash;further? At one-and-twenty
such questions need no answer. They belong to the
innocent rhetoric of youth which will cry out to
June, &#8220;Are you fair?&#8221; and to the autumnal moon
in mist, &#8220;Must there be rain?&#8221; Neither June nor
the moon make reply, but youth has no doubts. The
girl, weeping tears of joy over Rennes's perilous
words, had but one clear regret in her mind&mdash;she
could not see him for some hours. His declaration
dispelled the terrible bitterness, scepticism, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>difference
to all sentiment which had gradually
permeated, during their acquaintance, her whole
heart. Repulsed affection may turn to hatred in
haughty, impatient souls. But in Agnes it produced
a moral languor&mdash;a mental indolence&mdash;the feeling
that no one was in earnest, and nothing ought to
matter. The more this feeling deepened, the more
attentively did she observe the mere outward etiquette
of all that passes for seriousness, attending scrupulously
to the minor obligations of existence and exhausting
her courage in those petty matters which die with the
day and yield no apparent fruit. How different now
seemed the colourless, harsh fabric which she had
mistaken for duty and wrapped&mdash;as a shroud&mdash;about
her secret hopes! She had held every aspiration
implying happiness as a &#8220;proverb of reproach&#8221;; she
had endeavoured to believe that all poetry&mdash;except
hymns&mdash;was false prophecy leading one to hard entanglements
and grievous falls.</p>

<p>And what had been the impoverishment of her soul
under this grim discipline? How could she tell the
many thoughts which had travelled unquestioned over
the highway of her heart during that process of disillusion?
But all was changed now, and all that
had been difficult, painful or obscure in the world
seemed perfect with the inexhaustible glory of young
passion. Rennes begged her to see him once more before
he left England for some years. Would she meet him
in Kensington Gardens? She had often walked there,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>under the old trees, with himself and Mrs. Rennes,
and the place had become very dear, very familiar
to her from these associations. At any other time,
however, the idea of a clandestine meeting with David
would have been intolerable. To go now was misery,
yet she dared not stay away. The sunny morning
mixed with her mood, which was one of determination
to risk all in order to win all. Driven by a sense
of her capabilities for endurance, she faced, with a
kind of exultation, the possible disaster or remorse
which might follow her action. Was there not
a possible joy also? For ten days now she had
been ill in body as well as mind; she had suffered
a hard struggle. She knew now that she could not,
could not, could not, no matter what happened,
become the wife of Lord Reckage. The result
of great self-delusion for so long a period was a
condition of mind in which she was practically unable
to distinguish between candour and disingenuousness.
Any appearance of deceit&mdash;which she regarded as
wrong in itself&mdash;always excited her scorn, but desperation
now urged a step which might lead, she thought,
to much good or much evil. That it could lead
to more evil than a loveless marriage was not, however,
to be feared. She started from the house with
feverish cheeks, a beating pulse, and a new strange
consciousness of power&mdash;power over herself, her fate,
the world.</p>

<p>Rennes was waiting for her under the long avenue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>of trees by the Lancaster Gate walk. She had a tall,
stately figure of that type immortalised by Du
Maurier&mdash;indeed, she herself may be recognised in
some of his famous society sketches about the year
1870. The clear, decisive features, the tender discerning
expression, the poise of the head, were
irresistibly attractive to all artists with a strong sense
of grace&mdash;even artificial grace&mdash;as opposed to rude
vigour or homeliness. She possessed naturally that
almost unreal elegance which many painters&mdash;Frederick
Walker, for instance&mdash;have been accused
of inventing.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is very wrong of me,&#8221; she said, blushing as
Rennes advanced, hat in hand, to meet her, &#8220;very
wrong. I never do these things.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I said in my letter&mdash;right or wrong it matters not&mdash;what
I thought. This is a thing which runs up
into eternity, Agnes. It had to be. We needn't
try to justify it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot&mdash;I dare not regard it as you do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you have come! Let me look at you!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does it require much looking to see that I am
really unhappy?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see that you are beautiful, that you are here&mdash;with
me. Ah, don't be unhappy! When we take
into account our scanty time together&#8221;&mdash;he grew
pale at the thought&mdash;&#8220;and the danger we have just
missed of losing each other, perhaps for ever&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;
She caught his hand for a second and he kept it.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;What is to be done?&#8221; she asked, after an agitated
silence. &#8220;What will people say? Not that I can
think of <i>anything</i> to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling, I know I have asked you to make an
impossible sacrifice&mdash;to break off a most brilliant
marriage, to marry me and share the despair, hardships,
tortures of a life very different to any you have
seen. Well has Goethe said&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza"><i>
<span class="i0">&#8216;Love not the sun too much, nor yet the stars,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, follow me to the realms of night.&#8217;<br /></span>
</i></div></div>

<p>This is what I offer you, dearest. You can hardly
realise what a wretched, desolate existence mine has
been. Resignation is a miserable refuge. They say
work gives one contentment, but unless one is servile
and gives in to the spirit of the age, it is rarely understood
till one is dead. And so the discouragement
is perpetual. Even your sympathy would pain me at
such times. I feel then&mdash;as I feel now&mdash;that I will
grasp Fate by the throat; it shall not utterly crush
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said Agnes, a little frightened at this outburst,
&#8220;do you never think of God and His
Will?&#8221;</p>

<p>He returned her anxious glance with gloomy, almost
compassionate amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does God think of me?&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Really, I
cannot feel that the salvation of my soul is so important.
Indeed, any idea of immortality is awful
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>How could it ever be a consolation&mdash;except to a
smug, very self-satisfied egoism? Call it the burden&mdash;or
the cross of immortality&mdash;if you call it anything.
I wish it could be proved that we end when we
die. But physicians dissect <i>dead</i> bodies to find the
soul. It would not be a soul if they could find it
in the dead. And imagine one becoming penitent
when the day of grace is over!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I keep Clement's words before me, &#8216;<i>The Lord who
died for us is not our enemy.</i>&#8217; Surely that is a splendid
thought against final despair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many thoughts are splendid,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;if we
could believe them now as the early Christians did in
the first centuries.&#8221;</p>

<p>Agnes, with parted, whitening lips, could find no
response. Rennes painted her afterwards in the same
attitude, and with all he remembered of her expression,
in his now famous picture, <i>Pilate's Wife</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will never be happy&mdash;never,&#8221; she murmured
at last. &#8220;But perhaps no one is happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can grant that the saints were always profoundly
happy. Let me tell you why. The state of the saint
is one of dependence. His convictions, therefore, are
enduring and unclouded. He accepts his trials as
privileges; he loses all sense of his own identity; his
humanity is merged in God; his ecstasies lift him
up to heaven and bring him down to a transfigured
earth. He has been bought with a ransom, and he
is the co-heir with Christ. He is found worthy of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>suffering. But with artists, all is different. The
saint is in search of holiness. The artist thinks chiefly
of beauty. Holiness is a state of mind&mdash;it is something
permanent. Beauty, however, mocks one half
the time&mdash;it may be a deception. Anyhow, one
cannot define it, or keep it, or even satisfactorily catch
it. Our inspired moments, therefore, alternate with a
miserable knowledge of our individual wretchedness.
We learn that we are no stronger than our individuality.
That is the barrier between us and our
visions. The saint has God before his eyes, and he
carries Him in his heart. The artist sees only himself
and bears only the weight of his own incompetence.
But these, darling, are not the things I meant to
say to you, although they may explain my life. The
common run of people wouldn't understand all this in
the least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I want to hear all&mdash;I want to enter into all your
thoughts, David. I have always known that those
who devote themselves to the study of what is sublime
and beautiful suffer proportionately from the squalor
of actual facts.&#8221;</p>

<p>She quoted from one or her father's speeches which
he invariably gave with much earnestness at the
opening of schools of art and similar institutions.</p>

<p>&#8220;The world,&#8221; replied Rennes, &#8220;rewards the beautiful
only inasmuch as it flatters the senses, and the
sublime remains&mdash;so far as the general taste is concerned&mdash;altogether
without response.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But one would think,&#8221; said Agnes, &#8220;that you
were a disappointed or an unsuccessful man, whereas
every one admires your genius.&#8221;</p>

<p>He laughed at her practical bent, which seemed
the more fascinating because of her picturesque
appearance.</p>

<p>&#8220;One often feels cast down without the least cause,&#8221;
said he; &#8220;the truth is we all want more praise than
we get. We are a vain lot, that's the trouble. Let
me paint myself in the blackest colours. You must
know the worst&mdash;you must realise the bad bargain
you may make. Reckage would never bore and tire
you in this way. How can you care for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It <i>is</i> hard!&#8221; she said, smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling! Do you remember the white violets at
Woodbridge, and sitting on that gate looking across
that deep valley at the bonfires? Wasn't it perfect?
Look through these trees now&mdash;see the flames and
smoke? They are burning dead leaves and twigs. I
wish I could burn my past. This may be a good
omen for me. But I must not deceive you; that
would be a bad beginning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We must decide on some course,&#8221; said Agnes.
&#8220;Your letter was quite clear, but I suppose I am
not going on as I ought to do. My present position
is that of a person telling a lie to people. Before you
wrote, however, I had made up my mind to <i>some</i>
change. I could give no good grounds for carrying
out my engagement to Beauclerk. The motives
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>would not bear examination. I intended to be patient
till the way was mercifully cleared for me. Even
birds, in cold weather, grow tame from distress.
So I waited in a dull, frozen way for what might
happen.&#8221;</p>

<p>He remembered, with a pang of remorse, that he
had once called this devoted woman an accomplished,
incurable Philistine.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must put myself in the wrong with regard to
Beauclerk,&#8221; she continued quietly. &#8220;That is merely
fair to him. Every one shall know that I have been
weak and vacillating. May God forgive me and
humble me&mdash;for I shall not be understood, even by
many good people. But the next worst thing to
making an error is to abide by it. Dear David, try
to follow my feeling. It has all passed in my mind
in such a way that it is impossible for me to describe
it. In a sense, giving Reckage up seems to uproot me
altogether from all my former life, and the future
is only not a blank because it is such a mystery. I
am sure, though, that sorrow is never in God's
ordinance the <i>whole</i> law of life. These are great
compensations.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anything is better than to sit still and dream,&#8221;
said Rennes. &#8220;I have dreamt too long. I find
solitude oppressive. Yet you will admit how dreadful
it is to live among those who don't know or don't care
a bit about art.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there are other interests equally engrossing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not to me. And even Epicurean advice is only the
way to ignominious, contemptible happiness. I must
have an ideal life or else annihilation&mdash;splendid misery
or splendid content&mdash;nothing between the two.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not half showed your capabilities yet,&#8221;
replied Agnes. &#8220;We have to look upon this world
as the merest pilgrimage, but we can help each other.
I have hope because I have faith. Sara de Treverell
said the other day that, in men, experience often
makes mere callousness of character. Is this true,
David?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not of me; you have saved me from the worst
things. But it simply worries and almost exasperates
me to hear religious talk from any one. When I hear
a sermon I feel an inclination always to say, &#8216;My dear
fellow, can't you put your case better?&#8217; I want good
stuff about Divine and human nature&mdash;not this vagueness
and platitude. Why don't they tell one something
about the optimism of God, even before the spectacle
of men's weakness? But, instead, we are told to
moan about this vale of tears; we are promised
chastisements, disappointments, woes, persecution. A
philosophy of suffering makes men strong, but a
philosophy of despair is bound to make a generation of
pleasure-seekers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because the veritable world, even on its bare
merits, <i>is not so bad</i>. It is full of beauty, and interest,
and enjoyment. It is a lie to call it so many vile
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>names. One's good sense revolts. Do you think,
darling, that I could look at you, love you, be loved
by you, and call life a bad joke?&#8221;</p>

<p>Since the beginning of time this logic has held its
own against all scientific criticism. The two, being
secure from observation, kissed each other and accepted
the earth with perfect cheerfulness. They made some
plans, and after the agony of parting till the next day,
each went home to write the other a long letter.
In the course of the afternoon Rennes passed through
Arlington Street four times in a hansom and twice
on foot. Agnes was always at one of the windows
innocently observing the weather. He thought her
the loveliest thing created. He pitied, with benevolence,
all other men, and he spent an hour at his
solicitor's office, without begrudging the time, or
chafing under the fatigue.</p>

<p>Two days later Lord Reckage received the following
communication from Miss Carillon:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">My dear Beauclerk</span>,&mdash;</p>

<p>This letter will astonish and grieve you. I have
written several. None please me. All say too much and
yet leave all unsaid. I must send this one and trust to your
generosity. I am wholly to blame, wholly in the wrong.
I am no actress but I have been acting a part&mdash;the part of
a happy woman. My effort has deceived many&mdash;Papa,
Mamma, and, I believe, you among them. Dear Beauclerk,
you will think me ungrateful, false, weak. I don't excuse
myself. As I have said, the blame is all mine, and the
punishment must be all mine.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>
<p>When you receive this I shall have left England with
Mr. Rennes. He had arranged to go to the East for a long
time. (This will show you how little he anticipated any
change in <i>my</i> plans.) When I realised that I should have
to say goodbye to him, probably for ever, I found myself
unequal to the trial. I could not let him go alone. It is
bad for me to dwell too much on my feelings. I ought to
admit, however, that I have known all along, in a sort of
way, that I should have to give in <i>if he put the matter
before me</i>. I dislike the talk one hears so often about
inevitability&mdash;much of it is made an excuse for appalling
selfishness. At the same time, I understand what is meant
and feel strongly, that, while I am using my own will&mdash;I
cannot use it, <i>with a good conscience</i>, otherwise. Can you
follow this? In reality, I was disloyal to Mr. Rennes when
I became engaged to you. I was impatient, wilful, blind.
I did you both an irreparable&mdash;yes, an irreparable injustice.
He must always think me fickle, and you will always
condemn my weakness. I dare not ask you to forgive me.
I dare not hope for contentment after such a bad beginning.
One of Papa's favourite texts rings in my ears&mdash;&#8220;<i>Is
it a small thing for you to weary men, but will ye weary
my God also?</i>&#8221; I mustn't be insincere with God. But
I do want you to see that my affection for Mr. Rennes has
taken such a hold of my life that I simply cannot fight
against it. I am not sentimental, as you know: I can be
quite as sensible as other people about life and its obligations.
I don't expect romance or joy. Had I, by any
misfortune, met Mr. Rennes <i>after</i> my marriage with you,
I cannot bear to think what might have happened. It
isn't nice of me to say this. It is a painful, humiliating
reflection, and you won't like to think that you ever
cared&mdash;even a little&mdash;for any one so unworthy. In
your kindness you will say that this isn't like me. Bu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>t
indeed it is the real me. You have known the <i>un</i>real,
sham me. Every one of my friends will be surprised.
I am not surprised. And oh! the relief to be quite,
quite natural and straightforward at last. Nothing to
pretend, nothing to hide. I wish you had never known
me. Your ideals are so noble, and you depended on me
to realise a few of them. I think of the plans we made,
the hopes we formed. Alas! they were not for me. I am
going forward into the darkness. I don't see one ray of
light. Yet I haven't one misgiving or the least fear,
because I have the unalterable conviction that I am fulfilling
my true destiny&mdash;whatever it may be, good or evil.</p>

<p>All will agree that you are well rid of me. This is my
consolation. You have been kind, considerate, affectionate,
thoughtful always. And I have failed you.</p>

<p>Forget me, and never judge other women by me. I
have been exceptionally foolish.</p><p class="i8 nospaceabove">Your wretched friend,</p><p class="i8 nospaceabove"><span class="smcap">Agnes Carillon</span>.</p></blockquote>

<p>His lordship's emotion on reading this letter was one
of relief for himself&mdash;but pity and terror for the girl.
He was sincerely fond of Agnes, and the defiant
misery of her words filled him with forebodings. But
the sense of his own restored liberty soon dominated
every other feeling; and his anxiety about Miss
Carillon's future found complete assuagement in the
thought that character, under suffering, came out with
an energy and intensity which made, indisputably, for
progress.</p>

<p>When the news, after twenty-four hours, became
known, Agnes's wish to place herself in the wrong,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>beyond sympathy, or hope of pardon, was freely gratified.
No criticism seemed too harsh for her conduct.
No voice was lifted in mitigation of her offence.
Rennes was excused, because he was an artist, erratic
and passionate, and she was unfortunately beautiful.
The poor old Bishop, however, rallied under the shock,
preached more vigorously than ever, and showed a
proud countenance to his daughter's adversaries.
When he was able to announce to his friends&mdash;after a
painful fortnight of suspense&mdash;that the young couple had
travelled to Rome with Mrs. Rennes, and been married
at the English Embassy there, he gave way to a little
illness and indulged his grief. One could surrender
to legalised folly; one could name it. But sin and
scandal could only be faced by an implacable reserve.
&#8220;I may die of dismay,&#8221; said he to his wife, &#8220;but I
will not die of disgrace.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Scandal, meanwhile, was collecting her eager forces
for a great campaign against the Orange marriage.
It was unanimously decided that the affair could not
be hushed up. Sympathy&mdash;within wise limits&mdash;was
on the side of the lovers, but sympathy, nevertheless,
expressed a desire to hear fuller particulars. Society
journalism was, at that time, just coming into vogue,
and the weekly papers contained several references to
the strange rumour of an approaching divorce.
Hartley Penborough and the members of the Capitol
Club were wondering what line they ought to take.
They intended to stand by Robert, but they did not
wish to advertise their loyalty. The Carlton set were
divided into two camps&mdash;those who thought Orange
unlucky, and those who thought him an alien
adventurer. So far as these opinions touched his
career, both were damaging. The friends of Lord
Wight and Lady Fitz Rewes had always been jealous
of the young man. They discussed him now with
ferocious pity, announcing his ruin in every circle.
Sara de Treverell's associates were mostly of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>Diplomatic Corps. These, well informed about
Alberian affairs and Parflete's history, feared much
mischief. The old Catholics were dismayed at the
new convert's entanglement&mdash;especially as he had
recently been elected to Parliament. The more
timorous among them&mdash;in a panic&mdash;entertained unfounded
doubts about his orthodoxy, and the rest
deplored the injudicious attention bestowed on mere
recruits to the Ancient Faith. Converts then were
looked upon, in England, with a certain suspicion.
At that period the magnificent services of Dr. Newman
and Cardinal Manning were far more appreciated at
Rome than they were in the drawing-rooms of English
Catholic society. Orange, following his own instincts
and the advice of Newman, avoided rather than sought
the small group which attempted to make the Eternal
Church a Select Committee of the Uncommonly Good.
To one who had spent his youth in a great Catholic
nation, and came himself from one of the princely
families of France, the servitude necessarily involved
by the fact of joining any <i>coterie</i>&mdash;no matter how
agreeable&mdash;could possess no sort of attraction. His
Catholic friends were chiefly among the Jesuits, an
order which, by devotion, genius, and courage, has
excited that fear from all men which is the highest
homage this world can offer to integrity. His personal
sorrow, therefore, was not degraded by any foolish
additional worry about the tittle-tattle of this, that, or
the other personage. Tongues might wag; for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>self,
he could but do his duty and keep his account
straight with God. He hoped that a public law-suit
would be avoided. Baron Zeuill was using his
influence, so he declared, to arrive at some settlement
with Parflete. Parflete's agent was now in communication
with Robert's solicitors; he himself was known
to be in London, and he had even been seen dining
with foreigners at one of the small private hotels near
the Strand. The Alberian Ambassador informed Mr.
Disraeli that there was nothing to fear because Parflete
was not ambitious. &#8220;The corruption of egoism and
the insatiable love of pleasure&#8221; had done its worst to a
character never striking for its energy. He would
&#8220;desert&#8221; his wife again if she would give him a
sufficient sum. Mrs. Parflete, Disraeli pointed out,
was the last woman on earth to agree to such terms.
She was also perfectly well aware, he added, that she
was the legitimate daughter of the late Archduke
Charles.</p>

<p>&#8220;But,&#8221; said the Ambassador, &#8220;surely she will love
the glory of her country and the respect due to her
Imperial father's memory far better than her own legal
rights?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can't narrow the question to a mere sentimental
issue,&#8221; said Disraeli. &#8220;It is no such thing.
She has to defend her character. Orange must clear
his reputation.&#8221;</p>

<p>Disraeli had formed the opinion that Alberia&mdash;as
represented by His Excellency&mdash;was by no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>means anxious to see Mrs. Parflete's innocence
established; that, in fact, the whole disaster had been
planned and executed in the sole design of compromising
her status. All that had occurred, all that he
had observed led him to this conviction more and
more. It was decided that Brigit should be summoned
at once from Paris to take up her residence at the
Convent, where she had been well protected during
the earlier part of the year.</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;There is to be no appeal <i>ad misericordiam</i>,&#8221; wrote
Disraeli to Orange: &#8220;what you have done, you have done
in good faith and perfect honesty. Parflete, beyond a
doubt, will take some action. His conscience provides him,
in this difficulty, with the best means of self-advertisement
he has yet found. He has consulted several Bishops, the
Lord Chief Justice, all the ambassadors, and most of the
intelligent Peers. He wanders from one confessional to
another: St. Philip, St. Teresa, St. Benedict, and St.
Dominic are invoked perpetually for the disarmament of
his scruples. Vanity blinds him to the danger of assassination.
Alberia is in a red mood. <i>Carissime</i>, the dark,
inevitable hour will come. Be prepared for it. Depend
entirely now on the might of your religious belief. Men
cannot assist you. I have helped many, but no one has
ever helped me. Political life must be taken as you find
it, and it is neither in my disposition, nor, I am sure, in
yours, to indulge in complaints of unkindness. I have
reached a point now when I should like to quote Dante.
Consider him quoted, and believe me,</p><p class="i8 nospaceabove">&#8220;Ever yours,</p><p class="i12 nospaceabove">&#8220;D.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>The course of the intrigue may be followed most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>conveniently at this point in the document known as
Mudara's Confession.</p>

<p>Mudara, it will be remembered, was in the Alberian
Secret Service.<i>[See The School for Saints, p. 395.]</i> He it was who confirmed the false
news of Parflete's suicide, and did so much to hasten
Orange's marriage. He says in his narrative:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>The death of the Archduke Charles&mdash;which occurred
some weeks before it was anticipated&mdash;put the Alberian
Government to very grave embarrassment.</p>

<p>1. It was impossible to deny the legitimacy of the
Archduchess Marie-Brigitte-Henriette (known as Mrs.
Parflete). The rumour was officially denied, and every
proper measure was taken for the suppression of a fact
dangerous at all times and especially so during a national
crisis. Had the Archduchess been so ill-advised as to
stand upon her legal rights, the case would have been very
awkward for the Government. They intended, in any
event, to plead ignorance, and had prepared every proof of
their good faith in withstanding the claim.</p>

<p>2. It was clear, beyond a doubt, on the highest ecclesiastical
authority, that, if application were made, the
marriage between the Archduchess and Parflete would be
annulled at Rome. Parflete was regarded with great
suspicion. He was capable of any treachery. He could
not hold his tongue, and we know what that means at
Court. The one person he feared was the Archduke
Charles, and now that death had removed His Imperial
Highness, we understood what to expect from the disgraced
Equerry.</p>

<p>3. The Government's Agents had formed a very high
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>opinion of M. de Hausée (known as Robert Orange). It
was considered by the Government's advisers that this
gentleman would use all his influence to crush any foolish
ambition on the part of the Archduchess Marie-Brigitte.
M. de Hausée was himself of too noble a family to care in
the least for high-sounding titles or empty rights. M. de
Hausée (whose mother was Scotch) had become a British
subject, and had been elected to the English Parliament.
He was under the protection of Mr. Disraeli, had every
prospect of a brilliant political career as a Commoner, and
he had too much good sense&mdash;in view of the very large
fortune settled upon the Archduchess&mdash;to diminish it by
any imprudent insistence on a claim which, extremely
valuable as a ground for some advantageous compromise,
could only prove ruinous if pressed to any exact recognition.
The Government's advisers, therefore, approved
most highly of the marriage between M. de Hausée and
the Archduchess Marie-Brigitte-Henriette, and were
disposed to hasten it on by every means. On the news,
<i>properly authenticated</i>, of Parflete's suicide on Lord Soham's
yacht, I visited England and had interviews with the
Archduchess herself, with M. de Hausée at Catesby, and
with Baron Zeuill at Claridge's Hotel. The <i>proofs</i> of
Parflete's death were in perfect order, and the marriage
between M. de Hausée and H.I.H. took place in the
Chapel of the Alberian Embassy.</p>

<p>As I had made all the arrangements, I engaged the
servants for the reception of the bride and groom at the
Villa Miraflores. I was able to retain a small room at the
back of the house for my own use. On the day of their
arrival, I concealed myself, without difficulty, in the apartment
where Mr. Orange and the Archduchess had their
<i>déjeuner</i>. It was an unfortunate circumstance that I did
not destroy the telegram which I saw on the mantel-piece.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>But I supposed it contained some ordinary congratulations.
A more vulgar prudence than mine would have read and
burnt it in any case. My fault is, unquestionably, a most
inopportune delicacy of feeling. I witnessed the whole
scene between Mr. Orange and Her Imperial Highness.
It brought tears to my eyes, but as evidence it was valueless
for my purpose. She wept, stormed, and showed
much feeling. I was reminded in many ways of her
mother, Madame Duboc. M. de Hausée, of purer blood,
is like those players who, in spite of an air of indifference
at great losses, feel them none the less. I consider it my
duty as a gentleman to say that his bearing through the
ordeal did credit to his noble family and his personal
character. The Archduchess, who is foolhardy and
insolent, does not deserve such a lover, and it is grievous
to think that such a termagant should have so much power
over such a man. I regard her as I would some poisonous
reptile. Piety&mdash;which improves most women&mdash;only seems
to render her the more defiant, and love&mdash;which softens
most wills&mdash;makes hers the more hard. After parting
with M. de Hausée she swooned, and I thought what a
merciful thing it would be for all of us if she never
regained consciousness. This idea&mdash;which may have been
an inspiration&mdash;was before me, when I heard a slight
rustling behind the curtains. I pulled out my revolver
(although I had no intention of firing), aimed it, and said,
&#8220;Who is there?&#8221;</p>

<p>To my amazement, Parflete himself came out.</p>

<p>&#8220;For God's sake, don't shoot,&#8221; said he, &#8220;it is I.&#8221;</p>

<p>He cried bitterly at the sight of the Archduchess&mdash;for
she was looking extraordinarily beautiful. He cursed himself
loudly, put me to terrible anxiety, and I repented of
my recklessness in not getting rid of such a fool long ago.
With great presence of mind I rang the bell, and we with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>drew
to my hiding-place while the servant came in, raised
a hue and cry, and finally carried the insensible Archduchess
to a bedroom. When the coast was clear we
emerged. I asked Parflete what he meant to do, why he
was there, and how he had got into the house.</p>

<p>&#8220;To sound the soul of another,&#8221; said he, still maudlin.
&#8220;You must first have searched deeply your own. Remorse
has brought me here. My better nature reasserts itself.&#8221;
And more to that effect. &#8220;There is nothing new under
the sun!&#8221; he wound up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should there be?&#8221; said I, exasperated. &#8220;Come
to the point.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My wife is the purest, noblest of beings!&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will defend any jade on earth, provided she be
handsome,&#8221; said I, but seeing an ugly light in his eye, I
added, &#8220;but H.I.H. is certainly respectable. To this we
have both been witnesses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is to be done?&#8221; he cried, beating his head.
&#8220;Can I forget her interests? Who, better than I, should
take the place of her adviser, her Prime Minister?
Affairs in Alberia cannot long remain in this violent state.
There must be a <i>dénouement</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>I answered him sharply.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know quite well that the Archduchess can never
hope for official recognition from any Alberian Ministry&mdash;let
alone the sovereigns of Europe. An aggressive attitude
on her part could at most and at the worst, but lead to
these things&mdash;a change of dynasty, and the annexation of
Alberia by one of the Powers, or its partition among some
of them. We wish Alberia to become another Switzerland&mdash;a
little Paradise of law-abiding, industrious, rich,
independent people!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All the same,&#8221; said he, &#8220;my wife may not sell her
birth-right. Such a proceeding is directly opposite to the
Will of God.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She will be a good claimant&mdash;after all this scandal with
the Carlists and de Hausée,&#8221; said I. &#8220;I can imagine the
welcome extended to her by Bismarck! We have seen
enough of this kind of thing in France and Spain.&#8221;</p>

<p>We talked for an hour. He was as obstinate as a mule
and as incoherent as running water. I could grasp him
nowhere. It was like groping in a well for a lighted torch.
No doubt he had formed in his own mind some obscure,
incalculable intrigue, but no reason can guess the plans
which are made by an unreasoning person.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Archduchess is rich, young, and handsome,&#8221; said
I; &#8220;it would be folly to change her noble independence
for a political slavery fatal to her peace&mdash;perhaps her life.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But duty is above such weak considerations,&#8221; said he,
rolling his eyes. &#8220;My wife must remember the nation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you believe,&#8221; I rejoined, &#8220;that you would get the
nation's sanction to the general upset which you propose?
You must be mad.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nations go mad,&#8221; said he, smiling; &#8220;why not to my
advantage, then, as well as yours?&#8221;</p>

<p>He refused to tell me how he got into the house, but it
must have been by bribery. His sneers and insults were
insinuated with such skill that retaliation on the spot was
impossible. He made his escape by suddenly extinguishing
the lamp, which left the room in pitch darkness. I felt it
would be undignified to stumble about in vain pursuit of a
man so active and so <i>canaille</i> in all his methods. He must
have been on good terms with the servants, for a considerable
time elapsed before they replied to my summons, and
when I asked them, each in turn, whether he had been
seen, one and all assumed the greatest astonishment and
innocence, but none appeared in any way alarmed, which
they must have done had they not been well aware of his
presence in the house. I said no more, for, by treating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>the matter lightly, I made them look&mdash;to themselves&mdash;dupes
and very ridiculous. I remained at the Villa until the
Archduchess and Lady Fitz Rewes departed for Paris. I
had a short interview with M. de Hausée in my character
of the late Archduke's Agent. Our conversation was
purely in connection with H.I.H.'s money matters,
although he said with great firmness at the close, &#8220;The
Archduchess will never embarrass Alberian affairs. Her
taste is not for Courts or politics.&#8221; I know this is his
true conviction, but he is in love, and he measures her
by his own unselfishness. He won my heart strangely.
In all my experience, he is the one honest man who is not
a little idiotic into the bargain. I deplore the influence of
women on such a character, and I would have saved him
from that Judith.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here, for the present, we must leave Mudara's
narrative.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p><h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>


<p>The Alberian Ambassador, Prince d'Alchingen, considered
himself a diplomatist of the Metternich school.
He had imagination, sentimentality, and humour: he
preferred to attack the strength rather than the weaknesses
of mankind, and in all his schemes he counted
inconsistency among the passions, and panic among
the virtues. He still hoped that Orange might be
tempted by the prospect of immediate happiness to
press for the nullity of the Parflete marriage. Parflete
himself was indulging in the most extravagant demonstrations
of remorse. He behaved, as Disraeli said,
more like a cunning woman than an able man, and he
was an agent of the kind most dangerous to his
employers&mdash;irregularly scrupulous, fond of boasting of
his acquaintance with princes and ministers, so vain
that he would rather have had notoriety without
glory, than glory without notoriety. He had found
the means of ingratiating himself with many persons
of high rank, and he knew how to avail himself, with
each, of his influence with the others. Never did an
intrigue require more urgently a sort of conduct quite
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>out of the common routine. The Prince, therefore,
was much perturbed in mind, and cast about him for
a trustworthy associate. By an associate he meant
some one on whom he could test the quality of his
deceit&mdash;in other words, he liked to try his sword on
gossamer and granite before he struck out at commoner
materials. Among his friendships, he prosecuted
none with such zeal as that with the Lady Sara de
Treverell. As the member of a great Russian house,
she was especially attractive to Alberian speculation,
but her beauty and cleverness no doubt assisted the
Ambassador's determination to make himself agreeable.
The two constantly exchanged letters, and, as the
Princess d'Alchingen was an invalid who devoted her
hours to spiritual reading, she gladly permitted
Lady Sara's influence, realising&mdash;with the priceless
knowledge of a spirit made reasonable through pain&mdash;that
the girl was romantic and the Prince incurably
old. His flaxen wig heightened the tone of a complexion
much ravaged by gout and its antidotes. His
nebulous eyes with twitching lids were not improved
by the gold-rimmed glasses which magnified their
insignificance. He possessed a striking nose and chin,
but, as these features were more characteristic than
delightful, they offered his wife no occasions for serious
anxiety. Whenever His Excellency required feminine
advice, it was considered quite <i>en règle</i> that Lady
Sara should be consulted. The Princess herself drove
him to St. James's Square on the afternoon following
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>Mr. Disraeli's call. She sent <i>milles tendresses</i> to her
<i>chérie</i>, and bitterly regretted that she was not well
enough to leave the carriage. The Prince kissed her
hand, bowed superbly, stood bareheaded in a draught
till the brougham drove away (in these matters he had
no equal), and, having warned Sara of his intended
visit by a special messenger, he had the pleasure of
finding the young lady alone. Following her custom,
she was appropriately dressed for the occasion in
prune-coloured velvet, which suggested dignity, and
very beautiful antique Spanish lace, which symbolized
the long endurance of things apparently too delicate,
subtle, and trifling for the assaults of time. The
Prince kissed both of her white hands, and lamented
the obstacles which had kept them apart for so
many insupportable weeks. He had lived on her
letters. They had been, however, few and
short.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is troubling you, sir?&#8221; asked Sara, &#8220;you
look pale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;For once in my life I wish to do a foolish thing&mdash;<i>pour
encourager les autres</i>,&#8221; was his reply. &#8220;I intend
to meddle with a love-affair.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whose love-affair?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will tell you presently. I never venture upon
any work trusting alone to my hopes. I am not of
those who discover rifts in their harness only on the
morning of the battle! I prepare for all contingencies.
First, then, let me put you through a little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span>catechism. Do men ever believe evil reports about
the women they love?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The <i>posse non peccare</i> is not the <i>non posse peccare</i>,&#8221;
said Sara quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you mean that they can believe the evil,
but, as a rule, they won't?&#8221; returned the Prince.</p>

<p>&#8220;You translate freely, but you have caught the
spirit!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well. I come to my second question. Is a
man better off with a dangerous woman whom he
adores than with a good woman who adores <i>him</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All men who desire love, deserve it,&#8221; said Sara.
&#8220;The <i>means</i> to this are always, in a manner, certainties,
the <i>end</i> is always problematical. But those
who want love could never be satisfied with mere
welfare&mdash;never.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have a right to direct my opinion,&#8221; he
exclaimed; &#8220;where else do I hear such sound good
sense? The usual women one meets in our circle
are old, ugly, and proud&mdash;incapable of conversation
with persons of intelligence. My wife,&#8221; he added
smoothly, &#8220;makes this complaint about her lady
friends. It is very dull and very sad for her, although
she is a saint.&#8221;</p>

<p>No conversation or letter was ever exchanged
between Sara and the Prince without some emphatic
tribute to the sanctity, prudence, and charm of the
Princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;The dear Princess!&#8221; murmured Sara.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;And now,&#8221; said His Excellency, drawing his chair
an inch nearer, &#8220;I must be serious. You have
guessed, of course, that I am thinking about Robert
Orange and Mrs. Parflete. I stayed at Brookes's till
after twelve last night in hopes of seeing Orange. I
was discussing him with Lord Reckage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What did Reckage say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckage doesn't mind raising a blister, but he
won't often tell one what he thinks.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sara shivered a little and compressed her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckage is fond of Orange,&#8221; she said, &#8220;yet
there is a certain jealousy.... Formerly, Orange
had need of Reckage, and depended on him; now
Reckage needs him and depends on Orange. Could
he but know it, Orange is the one creature who
could pull him through his difficulties with the Bond
of Association. A man who has no personal ambition,
who desires nothing that any one can give, who fears
nothing that any one can do, who lives securely in
the presence of God, is a power we must not under-rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>She spoke with enthusiasm&mdash;the enthusiasm which
women seldom, if ever, display for principle on its bare
merits. By the deepening colour in her eyes and
sudden clearness in her cheeks, the Ambassador felt
that he had reached a point where the emotions
would have to be considered, even though they
might not be counted on.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not time to tell you all the nonsense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>Reckage said,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;So far as my own
judgment can serve for a guide, I believe that he
would like to see Orange under the care and discipline
of St. Ignatius.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He wishes him to become a Jesuit priest? How
selfish!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Such is my impression. He wants so competent
a colleague removed from the political sphere. If his
words and actions are of a piece, he will certainly
work hard to attain this object. He is saying everywhere,
&#8216;Orange is a born ecclesiastic. Orange is a
mystic. Orange is under the influence of Newman.
Orange begins to see that marriage is not for him.&#8217;
Such remarks don't help outside the Church. Really,
competition renders the nicest people detestable.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Sara could not conceal her agitation. But she
baffled her companion a little by saying&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you want Orange to marry your
inopportune Archduchess?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The lady in question is certainly inopportune. I
have never called her an Archduchess. I leave such
audacities to her enemies! But tell me what you
think of <i>Mrs. Parflete</i>?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never seen her. Pensée Fitz Rewes
insists that she is beautiful, cold, determined, and
uncommon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Generally, there is nothing so fatal to a woman's
success in the world as an early connection with a
scoundrel. I have odd accounts of Mrs. Parflete from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>Madrid&mdash;the Marquis of Castrillon and an upstart
called Bodava fought a duel about her in Baron Zeuill's
gymnasium. A man called William Caffle, who
attended to their wounds, has given me fullest
particulars of the affair. I don't wish to injure the
lady, but on account of eventualities which might
arise, I am obliged to look a little about me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand,&#8221; said Sara.</p>

<p>&#8220;The great point is not to let Parflete take the
lead in the settlement. His present course of action
isn't quite decent or consistent. Will Orange do
nothing? It is wise to make peace whilst there is
some faint appearance of choice left on the subject, so
there is no time to be wasted.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What ought Orange to do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckage declares that he will not appeal to Rome.
There he is well-advised. But as he has already
compromised Mrs. Parflete, surely his present scruples
are entirely new and unlooked for? We must both
despise him, if he should abandon her now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has never compromised her,&#8221; said Sara indignantly.
&#8220;He has even been ridiculed for his
honour. I had no idea, Excellence, that you were so
wicked!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How else could I know all the news twenty-four
hours before the rest of the world? This, however,
is no laughing matter. Parflete may ask his wife to
return to him. It may suit her purpose to agree.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! A woman who loves, or who has loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>&mdash;Robert
Orange? A few things in human nature are
still impossible.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prince d'Alchingen shrugged his shoulders, and
continued&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Parflete has a good back-stairs knowledge of
Alberian politics. We never deny this, but we
always add that he was dismissed, in disgrace, from
the Imperial Household.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is there much use in denying the fact that he
married the Archduke's daughter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We meet the case by saying that the Archduke
in his youth may not have been exempt from manly
follies. And Duboc was irresistible&mdash;she drove one
mad!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why all this fuss?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To avoid more fuss&mdash;on a large scale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have always heard that Mrs. Parflete has
no intention of giving trouble. They say she is an
angel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will find that she would far rather be an
Archduchess! Orange may discover that his Beatrice
is nearly related to Rahab!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I cannot think you are right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you should hear Zeuill and General Prim
on the subject. The Marquis of Castrillon is in
London. Our friend Parflete will soon be labouring
with copious materials for a divorce.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you assume such horrors?&#8221; said Sara.</p>

<p>&#8220;The imagination,&#8221; said His Excellency, &#8220;is always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>more struck by likelihoods than the reason convinced by
the examination of facts! My dear friend, let us survey
the position. Orange does not seem to have the most
distant idea of making Mrs. Parflete his&mdash;his <i>belle amie</i>.
Well and good. But ought he, at his age, so handsome,
so brilliant, so much a man, to renounce all
other women for the sake of a little adventuress? Can
nothing be done? If he could have some convincing
proof of her treachery, would he not turn to others
more beautiful, more worthy&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Lady Fitz Rewes,&#8221; said Sara quickly.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you like,&#8221; replied the Prince, in his gentlest
voice.</p>

<p>For a second or two each of them looked away.
Sara glanced toward her canaries in their cage.
Prince d'Alchingen leant forward to inhale the perfume
of some violets in a vase near him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Delicious!&#8221; he murmured, &#8220;delicious!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Disraeli,&#8221; said Sara, still gazing at the birds,
&#8220;has always wished for the marriage with Lady Fitz
Rewes. Yet what can we do? I cannot see the end
of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The heroic are plotted against by evil spirits,
comforted by good ones, but in no way constrained,&#8221;
observed the Ambassador; &#8220;let us then support
Mr. Orange, and wait for his own decision. I doubt
whether we could drive him to Lady Fitz Rewes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To whom else?&#8221; asked Sara, fastening some
flowers in her belt. They were white camellias sent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>that morning from the infatuated, still hopeful Duke
of Marshire. &#8220;To whom else&mdash;if not Pensée?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare not answer such questions yet. Have
patience and you shall see what you shall see. Much
will hinge on the events of the next few days.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not believe,&#8221; she insisted, &#8220;that Robert
Orange has been deceived by that woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may change your opinion. Come to Hadley
Lodge next Saturday&mdash;I ask no more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, sir,&#8221; said Sara, with a mocking smile,
&#8220;you frighten me. Am I at last to fly through an
intrigue on the wings of a conspiracy?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Prince smiled also, but he saw that the lady had
risen to the occasion and would not prove false to her
Asiatic blood.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Parflete and Castrillon are cut out for each
other,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but Orange has no business in that
<i>galère</i>. He is reserved for a greater fate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221; said Sara.</p>

<p>&#8220;All now depends on you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Plainly. Reckage wishes Orange to get out of his
way and become a Religious. Can this be permitted?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would be outrageous. It would be a crime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, worse than that. It might prove a success.
We don't want any more strong men in the Church
just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sara agreed. She, too, was opposed to the Church.
And she was glad of the excuse this thought offered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>for the pains she would take to save Orange from the
Vatican grasp.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then we are allies,&#8221; said His Excellency. &#8220;You
will help me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Gladly, and what is more, as a duty. But how?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep the two men apart, and treat both of them&mdash;both&mdash;with
kindness.&#8221;</p>

<p>His Excellency then rose, kissed her hands once
more, and took his departure. Sara, when the door
was closed, paced the floor with swift and desperate
steps, as though she were encircled by thoughts which,
linked together, danced round her way so that whether
she retreated or advanced, swayed to the right or to the
left, they held her fast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p><h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIX" id="CHAPTER_XIX"></a>CHAPTER XIX</h2>


<p>Lord Garrow, under his daughter's command, had
issued invitations for a dinner-party that same evening
to a few friends, who, it was hoped, would support
the Meeting which Reckage was endeavouring to
organise as a protest against Dr. Temple's nomination.
The guests included Reckage himself, Orange, Charles
Aumerle, the Dowager Countess of Larch, Hartley
Penborough, Lady Augusta Hammit, and the Bishop
of Calbury's chaplain,&mdash;the Rev. Edwin Pole-Knox.</p>

<p>Sara, arrayed in white satin and opals, sat at the
piano playing the <i>Faust</i> of Berlioz, and wondering
whether she had really arranged her table to perfection,
when the footman brought the following note&mdash;dashed
off in pencil&mdash;from Lord Reckage:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="i20"><span class="smcap">Almouth House</span>.</p><p class="nospaceabove">An extraordinary thing has happened. Agnes has run
away with David Rennes. She seems quite broken and
her letter is too touching, too sacred to show. As for him,
it is difficult to say what he could give, or what I would
accept, as an excuse. She, however, has my full forgiveness,
and perhaps good may come of so much sorrow and duplicity.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>I must see you after the others have gone to-night. My
plan is to leave early&mdash;probably with Orange and Aumerle,
but I will return later. I need your counsel. B.</p></blockquote>

<p>Sara, who was always in league with audacity,
clapped her hands at the tidings of Miss Carillon's
bold move. She was not surprised, for, as we have
seen, she had read the girl's character truly, and
warned Orange that some event of the kind would
happen. But the pleasure she took in this confirmation
of her own prophetic gifts was alloyed by the
fear that Reckage, now at liberty, would prove a
masterful, jealous, and embarrassing lover. Nor were
her forebodings on this score lessened when he arrived,
evidently in a strange mood, a quarter of an hour
before the appointed time. His eyes travelled over
her face with a consuming scrutiny to which she was
unaccustomed and for which she found herself unprepared.
For a moment she experienced the disadvantages
of a guilty conscience, and although she
had, so far, merely considered various plans for using
his devotion without peril to her own independence,
she felt that the moment for deliberation was past,
that the duel between them had begun.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have my note,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I would rather
not talk about Agnes to-night. On that point I am
in a stupor. I can't realise the disaster at all. I
might seem unfeeling, whereas I am insensible, or
unconscious, or mentally chloroformed&mdash;anything you
like to call it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can see that you have received a great blow,&#8221;
answered Sara, looking down.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose so. And at present I am stunned.
Wait a week, and I may be able to grasp the case&mdash;I
won't say calmly, for I couldn't be calmer than I
am at this very moment. But I will say, with understanding,
with justice. Give me no credit yet for
either. To be frank, I don't recognise myself in
this crisis. As a rule, I have an impulse&mdash;more or
less violent&mdash;to some extreme measure.... I saw
d'Alchingen this afternoon,&#8221; he added, abruptly.</p>

<p>He did not add that the Prince had given several
striking reasons for the Lady Sara's interest in Robert
Orange. His Excellency, in so acting, may not have
been aware that he was pouring such confidences into
the ear of a jealous man, but he wished to divert
gossip from himself, and he was becoming afraid lest
his intimacy with the brilliant, dangerous girl might
give rise to criticism. &#8220;She talks and writes incessantly
about Orange,&#8221; he had said; &#8220;what a marriage
it would be! I hope it may be brought about.&#8221;
This suggestion drove Reckage's thoughts toward
a fatal survey of the past year. He discovered, as
he believed, irresistible proofs of Sara's infatuation,
and, what was worse, clear evidence of Robert's sly
encouragement of that weakness. Why else had he
borne the severance from Mrs. Parflete with such
astonishing fortitude? How else did he keep up his
spirits in the face of a grotesque, if unfortunate,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>adventure? The answer was plain enough. Sara's
sympathy and the reasonable hopes necessarily attached
to so much kindness had sustained him through the
bitterness of all his trials.</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever thought,&#8221; said Reckage, with
pretended carelessness, &#8220;that Orange's serenity just
now is somewhat unnatural? Is it <i>all</i> religion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe that neither of <i>us</i> can form any conception
of his capacity for suffering, or the support
he finds in his Belief.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It points to fanaticism, no doubt. He is a
Cardinal <i>in petto</i>. The Catholics want spirit everywhere,
and Orange has got spirit. His vocation lies
toward the Vatican. His morals are as good as his
build&mdash;which is saying much. D'Alchingen was
remarking how extraordinarily well set-up he is. He
would have done well in the army. He cuts an
effective figure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is distinguished; would one call him handsome?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There's a nobility about him, of course. I am
wondering whether he is really so clever as many
make out. He is learned and thoughtful; he has
plenty of pluck and he's the best fellow in the world.
But&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I knew him better,&#8221; sighed the young
lady; &#8220;I liked him and believed in him on the
strength of your recommendation. That was an
immense prejudice in his favour.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>She looked up with a sweet and trustful smile which
would have satisfied a harder adversary than Reckage.
He was not so hard, however, as he was egoistic, and
it was not a question of softening his heart. Sara had
the far more difficult task of soothing his tortured
vanity.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know,&#8221; he said, losing caution, &#8220;that I
want you to take him up quite so strongly! No
one could call him a coxcomb, yet he, not aware of
the real cause of your interest, might be over-flattered.
He might, eventually, begin to hope&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;What?&#8221; she asked, with burning cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;All sorts of things. He's a man, and you are
beautiful. And I have heard him say a thousand
times that so-called Platonics are possible for one of
the two, but never for both. Doesn't this explain the
many cases of unrequited love? You are vexed,
I can see it. But I am not thinking of you. I am
thinking of Robert.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is not so sentimental as you imagine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Isn't he? This affair with Mrs. Parflete was
pure sentimentality from beginning to end&mdash;a poet's
love. He would have another feeling for you&mdash;something
much stronger. You are so human, Sara.
I would far sooner kill you than write poetry to you.
You are life&mdash;not literature. That little thing with
shining hair and a porcelain face is for dreams. Of
course, he will always love her&mdash;after a fashion. He
might even compare you with her and find her your
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>superior in every way&mdash;except as a woman. We
may be at moments poets, at moments saints, but the
greater part of the time, a man is a man. And you
are no friend for a man. Pensée Fitz Rewes might
answer well enough; she has had sorrow, she has
two children, she has a gentle, maternal air. But
you&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>He threw back his head and laughed without
mirth.</p>

<p>&#8220;You!&#8221; he repeated. &#8220;My God!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are talking very foolishly, Beauclerk. Perhaps
it is your odd way of making yourself agreeable.
It doesn't please me a bit to be told that I am a siren.
My mind is full of the Bond of Association and your
Meeting at St. James's Hall. How shamefully Lord
Cavernake has behaved, but dear Lord Gretingham
has come out well. What a miserable set we have in
the Lords just now!&#8221;</p>

<p>She was making these remarks as the clock struck
the hour, and her father entered the room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Beauclerk came early, dear papa,&#8221; said she,
&#8220;because he had something to tell us. His engagement
is broken off.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lord Garrow looked the grief appropriate to the
news, and disguised, as well as he could, his dismay
at its probable development. He murmured, &#8220;Tut!
tut!&#8221; a number of times, held up his hands, and
nodded his head from side to side.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish nothing said against poor Agnes,&#8221; observed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>Reckage; &#8220;her mistakes are those of a generous,
impetuous girl. Don't judge her hastily. All, I feel
certain, has happened for the best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tut! tut!&#8221; repeated his lordship.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am devoted to dear Agnes,&#8221; said Sara, &#8220;but
I never, never thought that she was the wife for
Beauclerk.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she stepped forward to greet Lady Augusta
Hammit, who was at that moment announced. Lady
Augusta was a tall woman about thirty-five years of
age, with a handsome, sallow face, a superb neck,
beautiful arms, hair the colour of ashes, pale lips, and
large, gleaming white teeth. Unmarried, aristocratic,
ordinarily well-off, and exceptionally pious according
to her lights, she was a prominent figure in all work
connected with the Moderate Party in the Church
of England. In her opinion, foreigners might be
permitted the idolatries of Rome; as for the English,
Wesley was a lunatic; Pusey, a weak good creature;
Newman was a traitor; Manning, a mistake. The
one vital force on whom she depended for her spiritual
illumination and her life's security was the Rev.
Edwin Pole-Knox. &#8220;Pole-Knox,&#8221; she said, &#8220;will
save us yet.&#8221; This good and industrious young man,
a few years her junior, had been chaplain&mdash;mainly
through Lady Augusta's devoted exertions&mdash;to three
bishops. He did every credit to his patroness, but
hints were already in the air on the subject of
ingratitude. Some said he lacked ambition; others
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>murmured dark conjectures about his heartlessness.
It was left to the Lady Augusta's fellow-labourers in
the sphere of beneficence to blurt out, with odious
vulgarity, that he would never marry her in this
world. She entered the room that evening in
her haughtiest manner, for Pole-Knox was following
close upon her heels, and she wished to justify the
extreme deference which he showed her so properly
in public, and perhaps with morbid conscientiousness
in <i>tête-à-tête</i>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't know how I shall get through the
winter,&#8221; she observed, in reply to Lord Garrow's
inquiries about her health. &#8220;I am working like a
pack-horse.&#8221; Here she caught Pole-Knox's name
and bowed mechanically, without seeing him, in his
direction. The entire afternoon they had been looking
together over the accounts of a Home for Female
Orphans, and poor Lady Augusta had been forced to
see that whatever fire and enthusiasm her <i>protégé</i>
could display in tracking down the orphans' dishonest
butcher, his respect where she was concerned verged
on frigidity.</p>

<p>Lady Larch was the next arrival, and as she
was famous for her smile, she used it freely,
not fatiguing herself by listening to remarks, or
making them. In her youth she had been called
bonnie; she was still pleasant to look upon. She
talked very little, and perhaps on this account her
few sayings were treasured, repeated throughout
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>society, and much esteemed. &#8220;Surely it is a mistake
to give men the notion that all good women are
dull&#8221; was one of her classic utterances. Another
ran, &#8220;Those who are happy do not trouble about the
woes of the human race.&#8221; Another, &#8220;The Dissenters
belong essentially to a non-governing class&mdash;a vulgar
class.&#8221; These will serve to show the scope of her
observation and the excellence of her intentions. In
fact, she was often found dull. She was not especially
disturbed about the woes of humanity, and her
maternal grandfather had been a Presbyterian cotton-merchant.
She bore Pole-Knox away to a far corner
and begged to be told all the latest details of Miss
Carillon's abominable conduct.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not exactly know,&#8221; said she, &#8220;the state of
things. The poor dear Bishop must be in a dreadful
state.&#8221;</p>

<p>Orange came in with Aumerle and Hartley Penborough.
Lady Augusta, who was a kind, sincere
woman, pressed his hand warmly, and showed with
her eyes that she appreciated the difficulties of his
position. He had aged, Sara thought, and he looked
as though he suffered from sleeplessness; otherwise,
in manner and in all ways, he was just as he had
always been.</p>

<p>Sara looked at him, and, looking, she read the secret
thoughts in his mind. Yes, she was to him, no doubt,
the undisciplined, passionate girl who lived on admiration,
excitement, and false romance. He owned her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>beauty; he excused her faults; he liked her. Of all
this she was certain. Reckage's warning had encouraged
her to believe that Orange's self-control was
a hard achievement&mdash;by no means any matter of a
disposition naturally cold. If it were merely to be
a struggle of wills, her will would prove the stronger.
She meant to have her way this time. Wasn't it the
critical moment of his life? Every instinct had been
roused&mdash;ambition, the love of adventure, the love of a
woman. For a short while the means had been given
him, humanly speaking, of gratifying these great
passions. And then, at a stroke, he was once more
poor and dependent, once more in a ridiculous position,
and the woman he loved was further from his reach
than ever. He still had the privilege of fighting and
breaking his heart in the market-place. He could
still enjoy some kind of a career. Yet the long,
embittering struggle with poverty and disappointed
affection could but appear to him now desolate indeed,
barely worth the difficult prizes of success. Lady
Sara was young, and she made the mistake, eternally
peculiar to her sex, of placing love first, rather than
last, among the forces in a strong nature. No
powerful being ever yet either stood by the glory, or
fell by the disasters, of a love-affair alone, uncomplicated
by other issues. It does its work: it must
touch, in many ways, the whole character; but it is,
in the essence of things, a cause&mdash;not an effect. To
Sara there was one only consuming interest in life&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>love.
All her talents were directed to the gaining,
understanding, and keeping of this wonderful human
mystery. She wanted wild scenes and ungovernable
emotions: she was beautiful enough to figure in such
situations, and fascinating enough to indulge in such
crises without offence to the artistic proprieties. But
she had resolved that the hero of her existence must,
at least, look his part. No one denied that Orange
had a remarkable personality. Every one admitted
that he was clever. These were the sternest estimates
of his claim to social recognition. But she knew him
to be a de Hausée. She thought him superbly handsome.
She had Disraeli's opinion that he was a
genius. Here was a case where love would not have
to be blind. Love, in this case, could defy the scornful
and the proud. At last she could say, &#8220;My fate!&#8221;
and call the whole world to witness her surrender.
&#8220;Whether he loves me, or whether he hates me,&#8221; she
thought, &#8220;I have chosen him.&#8221; Sinætha, weaving
spells by the moon, was not more determined or more
irretrievably in love than Sara. The danger of such
wild moods is as attractive to the very young as it is
terrifying to the more mature. Perfectly conscious
of her beauty, she felt able to defy, sue, and conquer
at the same moment. Orange had never seen her to
such brilliant advantage. The instant he entered the
room and met her eyes, which shone with a most
touching kind of timidity and a most flattering joy,
he had to realise the need of strict discipline where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>constancy is a rule of existence. Sara's laugh, movements,
way of talking, played a good deal on the
heart, but even more upon the senses. Brigit's lovely
face gained intensity only under the influence of
sorrow. Then it became human. At other times
it was merely exquisite. Now Sara's countenance had
all the changing qualities of nature itself. She had,
too, the instinctive arts of sympathy which are so
much rarer than the actual gift. Far enough was
Sara from the triumph which she was imagining; far
enough was Orange from the least disloyalty; but he
was fully alive to the danger of regarding her as a
woman to be fought against. To fight in such cases
is to admit fear of conquest.</p>

<p>&#8220;Those opals are beautiful,&#8221; said he, presently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad you approve of&mdash;the opals.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you put them to a disadvantage.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O! is that a compliment? The first you have
ever paid me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you care about them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;From you, yes. I was reading in Saint-Simon's
Memoirs yesterday that your ancestor&mdash;Charles de
Hausée&mdash;was the first swordsman, the bravest soldier,
the hardest rider, and the best judge of women in
France. But let us be serious. Lady Larch is
wearing her brightest smile!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Must we be very earnest this evening?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid so. You see, I have secured Pole-Knox.
He has never been permitted to dine here
before.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I once told Lady Augusta that he was a
man for the shortest part of the afternoon&mdash;not for
evenings, at all. She couldn't forgive this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she forgive it now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. She has reached the stage when one may
criticise him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That means a complete cure, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Far from it&mdash;resignation to the worst that can
be said of his character. There is no cure possible
then.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you had any conversation with Reckage?&#8221;
he asked.</p>

<p>Sara coloured and put her fingers to her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush!&#8221; said she. &#8220;There's a deceptive quiet
about him which puzzles me. But I don't think he
is sorry to be rid of Agnes. A regiment of relatives
drove him into the engagement. Now it has come to
an end&mdash;let us thank God!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your own conscience is easy, I take it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have no right to ask such a question&mdash;none
at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some men, you know, can be laughed out of their
loves,&#8221; he continued.</p>

<p>&#8220;Timorous men&mdash;yes! Is Reckage timorous?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You turned that most adroitly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you. Please sit between Lady Augusta
and Aumerle at dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dinner passed most agreeably. As little as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>possible was said about the Meeting; each talked to
his or her neighbour, and although the separate
dialogues may have been profound, the general effect
produced was one of restful flippancy. Pole-Knox
remarked over his fish that England had little to fear&mdash;unless
through the corruption of her religion, whereupon
Penborough declared that religion in the country
was a School, not a Church. To this Lady Augusta
rejoined that Rome's strength depended merely on
Canterbury's weakness.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forcing a change is a very ticklish business,&#8221; said
Aumerle, studying the menu, and regretting that his
digestion was not all it had been.</p>

<p>Lord Garrow deplored the fact that Mr. Gladstone
had embarked on a very vulgar and very false
policy.</p>

<p>&#8220;But its vulgarity,&#8221; he sighed, &#8220;gives it a very
easy reception.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He expects everything except docility,&#8221; said
Penborough; &#8220;if the Opposition employ that means,
they will embarrass all his calculations.&#8221;</p>

<p>Reckage, meanwhile, was confiding to Sara&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I turned the horse round, rammed my spurs in,
and put him at the rails again!&#8221;</p>

<p>One statement, made by Penborough, caused a
flutter.</p>

<p>&#8220;If Catherine of Arragon had been immoral and
Mary Stuart virtuous, the whole course of European
History would have been different. The Reforma<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>tion,
for instance, would have found no favour in
England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That's <i>very</i> advanced,&#8221; murmured Lady Larch.</p>

<p>Sara, at dessert, tried to encourage a debate on the
egoism of the Saints compared with the egoism of
Montaigne.</p>

<p>&#8220;They were selfishly bent on pain and renunciation,
he was selfishly bent on pleasure and indulgence.
Isn't that the one difference between them, Mr.
Orange?&#8221;</p>

<p>Orange refused to be drawn, but he promised to
lend her the <i>Acta Sanctorum</i> of the Bollandists in
sixty volumes in folio.</p>

<p>&#8220;After you have read them,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I will tell
you my ideas about Montaigne.&#8221;</p>

<p>Many other remarks were probably more amusing;
these, however, were the most characteristic.</p>

<p>When dinner was ended, Sara and the two ladies
withdrew to the drawing-room, where they discussed
with the utmost vehemence Orange's illegal
marriage and Reckage's broken engagement.</p>

<p>The sum and substance of their investigations were
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Lady Larch wondered what the world was coming to.</p>

<p>Lady Augusta declared that no woman yet ever
fathomed the heart of man.</p>

<p>Lady Sara maintained that it was a very good thing
for both young men to have had such reverses before
they finally settled down.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span></p>
<p>At this Lady Augusta forgot to sigh, and Lady
Larch lost control of her smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;How,&#8221; exclaimed Augusta, &#8220;can they forget so
soon? Can any settling down be in contemplation?
Are no deep, sacred feelings left?&#8221;</p>

<p>Emmeline Larch, who was a widow, said she
would never be hard on any one who tried to recover,
for the sake of others, from a shattering
bereavement.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear Lady Larch!&#8221; exclaimed Sara.</p>

<p>The three women formed a picturesque group
round the fireplace as the men entered. But the
card-tables were already placed, and Sara lost no time
in arranging a quartette for whist. Penborough had
to leave for the <i>Times</i> office. Pole-Knox had to hurry
back to Fulham. The young lady, who was known
to detest all games, was thus able to choose Robert
for her partner in a short conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me,&#8221; said she, &#8220;but&mdash;have you anything
to tell me about Mrs. Parflete?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; she is now with Pensée.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;May I call upon her? May I know her? Would
she see me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With pleasure, I am sure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't see her,&#8221; he said quietly; &#8220;I don't hear
from her. I don't write to her. And&mdash;I don't talk
about her. But I should like you to know her. She
needs true friends&mdash;who understand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you been to Prince d'Alchingen's, or has he
approached you in any way?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am to dine with him to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Has he said anything to you about the Marquis of
Castrillon?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not a word,&#8221; replied Robert, in surprise: &#8220;why
should he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe there is mischief in the air. Be careful,
won't you? Reckage is watching us. I think he
would like some music. He is so <i>triste</i> this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>She moved away, and played delightfully on the
guitar until the guests rose to leave. Then she found
an opportunity to tell Lord Reckage not to come back
again. She was tired, she said, and her papa would
think it too odd.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then to-morrow morning,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>She named an hour.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p><h2><a name="CHAPTER_XX" id="CHAPTER_XX"></a>CHAPTER XX</h2>


<p>Robert, on leaving the house, drove to Grosvenor
Gate, where he had an appointment with Disraeli.
The ex-Minister was sitting, in a flowered dressing-gown,
by the library fire. The blinds were not drawn,
for the night was bright and starry; the moonlight
streamed into the room, mingling strangely with the
soft glow of the green-shaded lamp. There was a
large bundle of documents on the table by Disraeli's
side, and a pile of Continental newspapers on the
floor. One of the latter he was reading, and, by
the slight curl of his mouth and the gleam in his
fine eyes, Orange saw that he was working out, to
his amusement, some train of thought which gave full
jurisdiction to his knowledge of humanity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bismarck,&#8221; said he, &#8220;is the first German statesman
who has not regarded newspapers as inconvenient
lumber. He wishes the Press to advance his great
ideas by assuming the place of the Universities in
training public opinion, and the place of the Church
in controlling it. He might as well strive to make
the horse into the lion, the mule into the unicorn, a
parrot into the soaring eagle! Any man who is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>written up into a place can be written down out
of it. Our friend will learn this too late&mdash;probably
about the time that we, in England, are adopting,
with enthusiasm, his present error. Ah, my dear
Orange, watch the sky and you will learn the hearts
of men. Observe the changing light, the clouds
driven by the wind, the glimpses of pure blue, the
sudden blackness, the startling brilliancy, and then&mdash;the
monotonous grey. They seem too hard for me,
at times. The clash between ideas and interests
makes our inheritance a grim battlefield, and there are
moments of mortification when one may feel tempted
to sell it&mdash;not for a mess of pottage, but for the <i>promise</i>
of a mess of pottage. Tempted, I said. There is
always a course left, if you have the courage to face
it. It may avail you; I cannot insure you even that.
But if I were in your place, I would try.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could never do better, sir, than to follow your
advice or your example.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never betray, then, the least depression at disappointments
or reverses, but seize the few joyful
occasions of life for the indulgence of any accumulated
melancholy and bitterness. By this simple rule
you will escape the charge urged against all the
ambitious, who are usually as intoxicated by success
as they are cowardly in adversity. It delights me to
see you in high spirits. Tell me the news, but first
give me your opinion of this little paragraph which
will appear in to-morrow's <i>Times</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>He took from his pocket-book a slip of paper on
which was written the following in Mrs. Disraeli's
hand:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>Mr. Orange, the new Member for Norbet Royal, is the
son of a French nobleman of very ancient lineage. It
was a condition of his adoption by the late Admiral Bertin
that his own name should be dropped, and he has accordingly
always borne that of the Orange family. The
circumstances of his birth were communicated to the
Queen before his naturalisation as a British subject, and
his presentation, by Mr. Disraeli, at Court.</p></blockquote>

<p>&#8220;Was that necessary?&#8221; asked Robert.</p>

<p>&#8220;A public man must speak out, and this expedient
occurred to me as a slight pull in your favour. The
two things in life which are really gratuitous are the
grace of God and one's pedigree! The rest depends
upon ourselves. Now you can't think how much I
am interested in every little detail of your mental
experiences. I believe you will be a Jesuit yet. I
have never concealed my respect for the Jesuits.
When Spain and France expelled the Society of
Jesus, they persecuted their truest allies. A terrible
price, too, they paid for that crime. You see, then,
that I understand staunch Catholics. If I could rouse
an Imperial feeling in England which would at all
correspond with the feeling of Catholics for their
Church! Sometimes I dream this may be possible.
Pope, the satirist, remained, in spite of his wit, a loyal
son of the Faith, while many dull worthies who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>shuddered at his epigrams were recanting daily either
from fear or for some worldly advantage. In the
same way, Robert, men who hate my novels because
they contain a few truths, would sell England, if they
could, to-morrow. I mentioned the fact about Pope
to a gentleman who complains that you are by no
means typical of your co-religionists in this country.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The very expression &#8216;typical Catholic&#8217; is a
paradox,&#8221; replied Robert, who always accepted
adverse criticism with good humour; &#8220;there is one
Spirit, but it has many manifestations. From the
apostles, saints and martyrs to the rank and file, we
have to recognise the individuality of each soul. In
fact, sir, is not that the very essence of the Church's
teaching?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So I have always understood. And we have not
heard the last of the &#8216;law of liberty&#8217;; although I
observe to my chagrin that many modern Papists
depart from those great principles which they should
take every opportunity of claiming as their own. In
the freezing snows of the world's solitude, a prudent
man does not try to make himself happy, but he is
less than a man if he allows others to make him
wretched. The flesh has its discomfort: the spirit,
however, has its illimitable conjectures. When all
else fails me, I may still find solace in conjectures.
Does it strike you that they may have, nevertheless,
a danger also?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is your own way of asking me whether I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>know my own mind! If you mean, Have I put all
sentiment resolutely from my thoughts, Yes. If you
mean, Have I determined to continue in my present
line till I have a call to some other vocation, Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>His heart was troubled, full of vague combinations.
The events of the day had seemed mechanical, foolish&mdash;a
course of sorrowful attempting and self-reproach.</p>

<p>&#8220;Both of your affirmatives are satisfactory,&#8221; said
Disraeli; &#8220;you are, I see, what the Americans call a
&#8216;whole-hog man.&#8217; Now let us consider ways and
means. I saw Prince d'Alchingen this afternoon.
He announces the increased distress and reformation
of Parflete. We must therefore prepare for further
villainy. Mrs. Parflete has confided to d'Alchingen
her desire to go on the stage. He encourages this
ambition, and she has accepted his invitation to Hadley
Lodge, where she will recite in his private <i>salle de
comédie</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert, though much taken by surprise, betrayed
no sign of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot tell what she will do&mdash;until she does
it,&#8221; he answered. &#8220;She may have great talents.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, one forgets that when Voltaire said, &#8216;<i>Il faut
cultiver notre jardin</i>,&#8217; he was quoting, with sardonic irony,
Saint Teresa! You cannot be pleased at Mrs. Parflete's
decision. The theatre in England is a sport&mdash;not an
art. In France it is an art, but,&#8221; he added drily, &#8220;it
embraces more than one profession.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Whether a woman be a saint, a queen, or an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>actress&mdash;once before the public&mdash;she is exposed to
severe discipline. And I don't fear for this one.
She will take her revenge on life by laughing at it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I daresay. D'Alchingen calls her <i>un peu étourdi</i>.
She has the audacity&mdash;she may have the fortune of
despair. Confess&mdash;you have run a little wild about her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ran off the track, if you like,&#8221; said Orange,
smiling.</p>

<p>&#8220;Women fascinate the hearts, but they do not
affect the destinies of determined men,&#8221; returned
Disraeli. &#8220;If you have not won anything by this
affair, it would be hard to say what winning is. There
is but one feeling and one opinion about the really
courageous stand you have made.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I must gain confidence all the same in my own
ability to keep my resolves when they are clear to me.
I once prided myself in that ability as the one gem in
my character.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may laugh at yourself as much as you
please. Beauty is as well worth admiring as anything
on earth, and the world is better lost for love, than
love for the world. At least, let us say so. I met
Reckage at the Travellers' yesterday, and had some
talk with him about his Association. I think it far
better that Aumerle should not resign, as he could,
and probably would, be very mischievous as a freelance.
Reckage is all for shaking him off, but these
things, in any circumstances, should never be forced.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I advised Reckage myself to sound each member
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>of the Committee privately. Then, at the general
meeting, he could form some just estimate of the
difficulties in his way, and in their way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Reckage, though a mean fellow, might give you
an opportunity to work a strong Sub-Committee,&#8221;
suggested Disraeli. &#8220;One cannot calculate on the
course of a man so variable and impulsive. He proposes
to get rid of Aumerle, and make concessions to
his set. It is an unhappy policy, and always unhappily
applied, to imagine that men can be reconciled by
partial concessions. I attribute much of Reckage's
behaviour to his fear of society. Society itself, however,
does not practise any of the virtues which it
demands from the individual. It ridicules the highest
motives, and degrades the most heroic achievements.
It is fed with emotions and spectacles: it cries,
laughs, and condemns without knowledge and without
enthusiasm. Pitiable indeed is the politician who
makes society his moral barometer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have urged him to be firm. Christianity was
never yet at peace with its age. There is no other Faith
whose first teacher was persecuted and crucified.
Viewed solely as a point of administration, it is disastrous
to cut religious thought according to the
fashionable pattern of the hour. This has been the
constant weakness of English Churchmen. They try
to match eternity with the times.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My opinion is that Reckage must act with considerable
caution, or he will find himself repudiated by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>every party. The English like a fellow to stand by
his guns. I come now to your own business. Will
you do me a favour? Before you reply let me define
it. I have been asked to send some good speaker to
Hanborough. The occasion is the opening of a Free
Library. Remarks&mdash;of a laudatory nature&mdash;on the
princely munificence of Hanborough's mayor, Hanborough's
corporation, Hanborough's leading citizens,
a eulogy of their public glories and private
virtues&mdash;with a little thrown in about Shakespeare,
Scott, and the Lord-Lieutenant of the county&mdash;would
be adequately appreciated. The attendance
will be large: the nobility, gentry, and clergy of the
neighbourhood will flower about you on the platform;
a banquet will follow in the evening, and in the
morning blushing girls will hand you bouquets at the
railway station. Can you refuse?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not easily, I admit,&#8221; said Robert, laughing; &#8220;but
Reckage is rather low and unhappy just now about his
broken engagement. Wouldn't such an adventure
as this take him out of himself?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is not an adventure&mdash;this is an opportunity,&#8221;
said Disraeli; &#8220;it would be nursed into a stepping-stone.
I know fifty men who are worrying themselves
to death to get it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not tell me that,&#8221; replied Robert, with
gratitude. &#8220;It would be a great thing for me. But
Reckage is always at his best in functions of the kind.
Hanborough might make much of him, and then
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>his Association would feel flattered by reflected
honours.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You invariably set your face against your own
advantages, and I am afraid I shall not live to see you
where you ought to be. However, Reckage shall have
the invitation. Now, good-night. By the by, have
you heard that Castrillon is now in the marriage-market?
His mistress has given her consent, and
the Prince has promised his blessing. Could things
look more auspicious? Good-night.&#8221;</p>

<p>For the second time that evening Castrillon's name
fell with a warning note on Robert's ear. Disraeli,
he knew, would not have mentioned him out of sheer
idleness. There was some danger threatening in that
quarter, and it was impossible to dissociate this from
Brigit. The Marquis of Castrillon had been with her
in Madrid, and also at Baron Zeuill's palace after the
escape from Loadilla.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is Castrillon now?&#8221; asked Robert.</p>

<p>&#8220;I understand he is in London,&#8221; answered Disraeli;
&#8220;at Claridge's Hotel. D'Alchingen and he are on
excellent terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221; said Robert, tightening his lips. &#8220;You
will find he has been invited to Hadley.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I haven't a doubt of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I must contrive to see him first.&#8221;</p>

<p>Early the following morning Orange presented
himself at the house of an old, very devout priest
of his acquaintance.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Father,&#8221; said he, &#8220;this afternoon or to-morrow I
may be in circumstances of danger.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What danger is this?&#8221; asked the priest.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a man whom I may be compelled, in
defence of my honour, to challenge to a duel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To approach the Sacrament in such a frame of
mind,&#8221; said the old man, &#8220;is not to prepare yourself
for danger. For to come to confession with a determination
of taking vengeance is to put an obstacle to
the grace of the Sacrament. You must preserve your
honour by some other way. Indeed, the honour you
think to preserve by this is not real honour, but merely
the estimation of bad men founded on bad principles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Orange, hotly; &#8220;it is impossible,
however, to withdraw now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you should be beaten,&#8221; returned the other, who
had been in the army himself as a youth, and could
comprehend the worldly view of the situation, &#8220;if you
should be beaten, what becomes of the honour you
wish to defend? And if you should be killed in that
state of soul in which you go to the duel, you will go
straight to hell and everlasting shame.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I implore you, Father, to pray for me, and to
hear my confession, if you possibly can.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly, I cannot hear you,&#8221; said the priest.
&#8220;But this is what I will do. Wear this <i>Agnus Dei</i>,
and perhaps God will have mercy on you for the sake
of this, and afford you time for penance. Understand,
however, I do not give it to you in order to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>encourage you in your bad purpose, but that you may
wear it with all reverence and respect, and perhaps be
moved to obedience.&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert thanked him, accepting the gift in a right
spirit. His self-will, however, was aroused. He had
determined to fight Castrillon, and fight he would.</p>

<p>Sara awoke that same morning with a foreboding
heart. She wrote a letter to Reckage postponing his
call, and another to Pensée Fitz Rewes, asking her to
be at home that afternoon. At half-past two the
young lady drove up, in her brougham, to the widow's
door in Curzon Street. The blinds were down, and
the house gave every indication that its owner was
not in London. Sara, however, was admitted, and
Pensée received her in a little room, hung with lilac
chintz and full of porcelain, at the back of the house.
Pensée, wearing a loose blue robe, seemed over-excited
and sad&mdash;with that sadness which seems to fall upon
the soul as snow upon water. She was reclining on
the sofa, reading a worn copy of Law's <i>Serious Call</i>
which had belonged to the late Viscount, and bore
many of his pencil-marks. This in itself was to Sara
a sign of some unusual melancholy in her friend.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why,&#8221; she said, kissing her soft, pale cheek,
&#8220;why didn't you let me know that you had returned?
I thought you were still in Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear,&#8221; said Pensée, sitting up with a sudden
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>movement and supporting herself on her two hands.
&#8220;I am no longer my own mistress. I have become
a puppet&mdash;a marionette: a kind of lady-in-waiting&mdash;a
person to whom women talk when they have
nothing to say, and to whom men talk when they
have nothing to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sara chose a seat and studied the speaker with a
new curiosity. She was charming; vexation gave
humanity to her waxen features, and the flash in her
eyes suggested hitherto unsuspected fires in her
temperament, &#8220;She has more spirit than I gave her
credit for,&#8221; thought Sara, and she added, &#8220;Darling!&#8221;
aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Darling, indeed!&#8221; said Pensée. &#8220;I can tell you
I am tired of being a darling. There are limits.... I
have no patience with Brigit, and Robert drives me
to the conclusion that good men are fools&mdash;fools! I
suppose he told you that I was in town again?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, he won't come and see me himself because
<i>she</i> is here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is merely a decision on principle. He longs
to come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Quite so. But the girl does not deserve him.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sara showed no astonishment; she maintained her
thoughtful air, and replied with tranquillity&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;He thinks she is perfect.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I find no vulgar faults in her, myself, although
there seems no foolish thing left that she hasn't done.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>I am sure that every one will think her light, worldly,
and frivolous. Let me say what I have been through.
After the first terrible day and night at St. Malo, there
was no more crying. There was not another tear.
We went to Paris. She spent all her mornings at
Notre Dame, all her afternoons with old Monsieur
Lanitaux of the Conservatoire, all her evenings at the
theatre. She found many of her mother's old friends.
In the theatrical world I find much loyalty toward
those actually born in the profession. They treated
her as though she were a young queen. Lanitaux
managed to get her privately before the Empress
Eugénie. She sang for the Empress: the Empress
cried and gave her an emerald ring.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then she has talent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Genius, I believe,&#8221; said Pensée, solemnly. &#8220;This
makes her hateful and lovable at the same moment.
She is determined to be an actress. She never speaks
of Robert, and she shuts herself up in her room
reciting Marivaux and Molière. The d'Alchingens
have invited her to Hadley next Saturday. They
encourage her theatrical ideas. And why? They
wish her to lose caste. She is an Archduchess, Sara,
an Alberian Archduchess. What a living argument
against unequal marriages!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will she go to Hadley?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes&mdash;wholly against my advice. I don't trust
Prince d'Alchingen.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How I wish I could see her!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She is in the library now. I will ask her to come
down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pensée left the room, and Sara paced the floor till
she returned.</p>

<p>&#8220;She is coming,&#8221; said Pensée, &#8220;be nice to her&mdash;for
Robert's sake!&#8221;</p>

<p>Sara nodded, and both women watched the door till
the handle moved, and Mrs. Parflete entered.</p>

<p>She was dressed in violet silk without ornaments or
jewels of any description. Her face was slightly
flushed, and the colour intensified the pale gold diadem
of her blonde hair. The expression&mdash;sweet-tempered,
yet a little arrogant&mdash;of her countenance and its
long oval form bore a striking resemblance to the
early portraits of Marie Antoinette. Her under-lip
had also a slight outward bend, which seemed an
encouragement when she smiled, and contemptuous
when she frowned. Her figure&mdash;though too slight
even for a girl of seventeen&mdash;was extraordinarily
graceful, and, in spite of her height, she was so
well proportioned that she did not appear too tall.
Youth showed itself, however, in a certain childlikeness
of demeanour&mdash;a mixture of timidity, confidence,
embarrassment, and, if one looked in her
face for any sign of the emotions she had experienced,
or the scenes in which she had played
no feeble part, one sought in vain. Gaiety covered
the melancholy, almost sombre depths in her character.
And it was the gaiety of her French
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>mother&mdash;petulant, reckless, irresistible, giddy, uncertain.
As a child, dressed up in ribbons and lace, with
flowers in her hair, she had been the chief amusement
and plaything of Madame Duboc&mdash;to be held on her
lap, perched upon the piano, placed on high cushions
in the carriage, and lifted on the table of the drawing-room,
where she entertained a brilliant, if dissipated
company, by her talk, her little songs, her laughter, her
mimicry, and her dancing. She rarely danced now,
yet all the seductive arts of perfect dancing seemed
hers by right of birth. Each movement, each gesture
had a peculiar charm, and her dark blue eyes, the more
provocative for their lack of passion, were full of a
half-mocking, half-tender vivacity. Sara, a beautiful
young woman herself, surveyed this unconscious rival
and recognised, with good sense, a fatal attractiveness
which was stronger than time and far above beauty.
It was the spell of a spirit and body planned for
fascination and excelling in this indefinable power.
Had she been born to ruin men? thought Sara. Had
she been given a glamour and certain gifts merely to
perplex, deceive, and destroy all those who came
within the magic of her glance? History had its
long, terrible catalogue of such women whose words
are now forgotten, whose portraits leave us cold, yet
whose very names still agitate the heart and fire the
imagination. Was Brigit one of these?</p>

<p>She had nothing of the deliberate coquette who,
eager to please, keeps up an incessant battery of airs
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>and graces. Her enchantments depended rather on
the fact that she neither asked for admiration nor
valued it. Free from vanity, and therefore indifferent
to criticism, the bitternesses which destroy the peace of
most women never entered her mind. The man she
had chosen gave her no cause for jealousy, and, while
she enjoyed men's society, she had been so accustomed
to it from her earliest days that she had nothing to fear
from the novelty of their friendship, or the danger of
their compliments. Not prudish, not morbid, not
envious, not sentimental, and not indolent, she was
perhaps especially endowed for the tantalising career
which the stage offers to the ambitious of both sexes.
Acting came to her as music comes to the true
musician. She never considered whether she would
become a great actress or a rejected one: the art in
itself was her delight, and she found more happiness
in reciting Molière and Shakespeare alone in her own
room than she ever received, even at the height of her
fame, from her triumphs before the world. There
was, no doubt, a great craving in her nature for
innocent pleasures and excitement. She loved gay
scenes, bright lights, beautiful clothes, lively music,
witty conversation. She had been born for the
brilliant Courts of the eighteenth century when life
in each class was more highly concentrated than is
possible now&mdash;when love was put to severer tests,
hatred permitted a crueller play, politics asked a more
intricate genius, and art controlled the kingdom of the
Graces.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span></p>
<p>The three women as they faced each other presented
a remarkable picture. Pensée, the eldest, who
alone knew the lessons of physical pain, had a pathetic
grace which made her seem, in comparison with the
others&mdash;radiant with untried health,&mdash;some gentle,
plaintive spirit from a sadder sphere. Her clinging
blue robe appeared too heavy for the frail body; her
fair curls and carefully arranged <i>chignon</i> were too
modish for the ethereal yet anxious countenance; the
massive wedding-ring seemed too coarse a bond for the
almost transparent hand which trembled nervously on
the cover of the <i>Serious Call</i>. Sara, in black velvet
and sable, with ostrich plumes and golden beads, with
flashing eyes and a gipsy's flush, with all the self-command
of a woman trained for society, living for
it and in it, with all the self-assurance of a woman in
an unassailable position, handsome, rich, flattered,
spoiled, domineering, and unscrupulous, with all the
insolence of an egoism which no human force could
humiliate and no human antagonist terrify, Sara seemed
the one who was destined to succeed superbly in the
war of life. Mrs. Parflete&mdash;whose courage, determination,
and powers of endurance were concealed
by a face which might have been made of lovely
gauze&mdash;seemed less a being than a poetical creation: a
portrait by Watteau or Fragonard stepped from its
frame, animated by pure fancy, and moving, without
sorrow and without labour, through a charmed
existence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span></p>
<p>She made two steps forward when Sara advanced to
meet her, holding out both hands and smiling with
real kindness at the sight of a delightful apparition
which looked too fragile to excite such a fierce emotion
as jealousy.</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe we are to meet at Hadley,&#8221; said Sara.
&#8220;I hear you are going to act.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; replied Brigit, with a slight note of irony
in her musical voice. &#8220;I am going to act.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How charming! And what will you play?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I play the Marquise in one of Marivaux's
comedies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And who will play the Marquis?&#8221; asked Sara.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no Marquis,&#8221; answered Brigit, laughing
a little. &#8220;But,&#8221; she added, &#8220;there is a Chevalier and
a Comte. One of Prince d'Alchingen's attachés will
play the Comte. M. de Castrillon will play the part
of the Chevalier.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Castrillon!&#8221; exclaimed Sara, in amazement.</p>

<p>&#8220;The Marquis of Castrillon!&#8221; cried Pensée, turning
livid; &#8220;pray, pray put it off till you have heard
from Baron Zeuill. Dear Brigit! for my sake, for
Robert's&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is for your sake and Robert's that I have
accepted the invitation to Hadley. I wish you would
understand. I must show them all that I mean what
I say.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But Castrillon is a wicked wretch&mdash;a libertine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We have already acted together in this very piece
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>at Madrid. Much depends on my playing well next
Saturday. I am quite sure of his talent, and, in such
a case, his private morals are not my affair. He is no
worse than Prince d'Alchingen was, and most of his
associates are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can't know what you are saying,&#8221; answered
Pensée. &#8220;You will be so miserable when you find
you have been madly obstinate. It is very hard, in a
country like England, for a young woman to set herself
in opposition to certain prejudices.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are the Duke and Duchess of Fortinbras respectable?&#8221;
asked Brigit.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a question!&#8221; said Pensée; &#8220;of course
they are most exclusive.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then if they are quite willing that their daughter
Clementine should marry Castrillon, surely he may
play the Chevalier to my Marquise.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't think, Pensée,&#8221; put in Sara, &#8220;that
Castrillon is exactly tabooed. In fact, one meets him
everywhere in Paris, and, beyond a doubt, the Fortinbrases
and the Huxaters and the Kentons made a great
fuss over him last season. But do you <i>like</i> him?&#8221; she
said, suddenly turning to Brigit.</p>

<p>The question was skilful.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't take him seriously,&#8221; answered Brigit;
&#8220;he has the great science of <i>l'excellent ton dans le
mauvis ton</i>. You would say&mdash;&#8216;he is vulgar in the
right way.&#8217; I feel sure he never deceived women.
They may have been foolish but they must have been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>frail before they met him! He can be ridiculous in
five languages, but he cannot be sincere in one
of them. As for his wickedness, one must have
more than bad intentions; one must have the
circumstances. I have nothing to fear from M. de
Castrillon. He knows me perfectly well.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am simply wretched about you,&#8221; said Pensée;
&#8220;of your future I dare not think. I try to be
<i>sympathique</i>, and your difficulties come very home
to me because I have had such great sorrows myself.
But I have little hopes of doing any good while you
are so self-willed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dearest,&#8221; exclaimed Brigit: &#8220;trust me!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My child, you are &#8216;wiser in your own eyes than
seven men that can render a reason.&#8217; I implore you
to abandon this mad scheme; I implore you to
abandon these wrong&mdash;these dangerous ideas of the
stage. I know how much I am asking, and how
little right I have to ask anything, but I think you
ought to listen to me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brigit, with a sparkling glance at Sara, stroked
Pensée's cheek, and pinched her small ear.</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Mon cher coeur</i>,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I do not forget your
goodness. And I needed it, for I have been so
wretched and forsaken. My soul is weighed down
with troubles, and grief, and anxiety: each day I
expect some new misfortune: you are the one friend
I may keep. But you would not know how to
imagine the intrigues and falsehoods which surround
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>me on every side. <i>O mon amie</i>, I must prove to them
that I want nothing they can give me&mdash;that I possess
nothing which they can take away.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what she means, Pensée,&#8221; said Sara;
&#8220;she has to show d'Alchingen that her interests are
fixed on art&mdash;not politics. And, from her point of
view, she is right. I must say so, although I don't
wish to interfere. And so long as she knows M. de
Castrillon, it is better taste to make her first appearance
with him than with some strange actor engaged
for the occasion. After all, Mario was well known
as the Marchese di Candia before he adopted the
operatic stage as a profession. As for gossip, how is
anybody's tongue to be stopped?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not expect that people's tongues should be
stopped,&#8221; rejoined Pensée.</p>

<p>&#8220;What the world says of me I have learned to
disregard very much,&#8221; said Brigit: &#8220;if I vex my
friends, I must nevertheless follow my vocation. It
was good enough for my mother. I do not apologise
for her existence, nor do I offer excuses for my own.
She was an actress: I am an actress. She succeeded:
I may not succeed. But if you fear for my faith and
my character, it would be quite as easy to lose both
in the highest society as in the vilest theatres! I
foresee mistakes and difficulties. They must come.
I shan't have a happy life, dearest Pensée: I
don't look for happiness. Why then do you scold
me?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not scolding,&#8221; said Lady Fitz Rewes: &#8220;I
have never blamed you, never&mdash;in my heart. We
shall get on better now that we have brought ourselves
to speak out. How different it is when one
judges for oneself or for another! I do believe in
having the courage of one's convictions. But it was
my duty to warn you&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is all I wanted,&#8221; exclaimed Brigit; &#8220;that
we should understand each other and stand close by
each other. I am not on the edge of a precipice&mdash;I
am at the bottom of it already!&#8221; Her eyes had
grown calm from the mere force of sadness. &#8220;You
mustn't ask me to look back,&#8221; she added: &#8220;you
mustn't ask me to choose again. A simple, quiet life
is out of the question now. I have to learn how to
forget.&#8221;</p>

<p>She moved to the door, kissed her hand to Pensée,
and bowed prettily to Sara.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must get back to my work,&#8221; she said, and so
left them. The two women turned toward each
other.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no hope for Orange,&#8221; observed Sara
drily: &#8220;no man would ever forget her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He needn't forget her, but&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, it would have to be sheer, absolute forgetfulness.
I like her. I like all beautiful things&mdash;pictures,
statues, bronzes, porcelains, and white
marble visions! She is a white marble vision. And
Orange will love her forever and ever and ever.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>And when she is dead, he will love her still
more!&#8221;</p>

<p>She threw back her head and laughed&mdash;till Pensée
laughed also. Then they wished each other goodbye,
and parted.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span></p><h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII</h2>


<p>When Sara reached home, she was dismayed to hear
that Lord Reckage had called during her absence and
was waiting for her return. The prospect of an interview
with him seemed so disagreeable that she walked
first to the library, and sat there alone, for some
moments, before she could summon the presence of
mind which every sense warned her would be required
for the ordeal. At last, with a pinched heart, she went
up the great staircase, and found Reckage writing at
her own table in the drawing-room. He turned
quickly, and jumped to his feet at the rustle of her
dress. He was looking unusually handsome, she
thought, very animated, very dashing.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will forgive these clothes,&#8221; said he, &#8220;but I
have ordered Pluto round at four o'clock, and I am
going for a long ride.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a strange idea!&#8221; she answered, taking off
her gloves. &#8220;Where are you going?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Hampstead Heath. I need the air and the
exercise. I have to compose a speech.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The speech for the Meeting?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>His brow darkened, and he pushed back with his
foot a log which was falling from the open grate.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, not that speech. Another. Disraeli has
asked me to go in his stead to Hanborough. I don't
like to attach over-importance to the invitation, but
he must mean it as an encouragement. Evidently, he
wishes to show that Aumerle and the rest are without
any shadow of right in their attacks. I have been
above five years working up this society, and if, at the
end of that time, I am president only by dint of
<i>family interest</i>, be assured the situation cannot be
worth having. When I leave, it will go all to
pieces.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you don't intend to leave, surely?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, I do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you hinted at resignation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I sha'n't hint. Hints belong to the unconsidered
patience of fools. I won't give them an inkling
of my real tactics. Let them lollop along in their
own wretched fashion to some final imbecility! I
have other matters to think of, Sara. Doesn't Disraeli's
action say, as delicately as possible, that I am wasting
my time over small men? I have been altogether too
easy of access. Simplicity and consideration are
thrown away on the Snookses and the Pawkinses!
With these gentry, one must be a vulgar, bragging
snob, or they think one is not worth knowing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you owe it to yourself and to Orange to hold
the Meeting to-morrow?&#8221; she said, anxiously.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;There is a way out of it,&#8221; he answered, avoiding
her eyes. &#8220;We can talk of that presently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nothing interests me more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not true,&#8221; he said, taking a chair near her;
&#8220;there are many things which must interest both of
us much, much more than that stupid Meeting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I prefer not to speak of them now, Beauclerk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can't go on in this uncertainty. I am beginning
to think I am a blundering fellow&mdash;where women are
concerned. When we were together as children, I
seem to remember, looking back, that I always did
the wrong thing. And later&mdash;when you came out
and I fancied myself a man of the world, it was the
same. I don't know exactly what a girl is at eighteen,
but I know that a fellow of twenty-five is an ass.
He is probably well-meaning: he isn't hardened by
ambition and he is pretty sentimental, as a rule. Yet
he doesn't have fixed ideas. One day it dawned upon
me that I was in love.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now don't say that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I repeat it. I am far from wishing to pose as a
martyr, but whenever one is happy, all one's friends
think that one is going to make some fatal mistake.
I suppose no battle can be won without a battle. But
life has always had a good deal of painfulness to me,
and I hate opposition. It isn't lack of courage on
my part&mdash;I can fight an enemy to the death. When
it comes to quarrelling with relatives or those I care
about&mdash;well, I own I can seldom see good reasons for
keeping a stiff neck.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am perfectly convinced of your spirit, Beauclerk;
every circumstance serves to show it. There was
never a time when you did the wrong thing&mdash;in my
judgment.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are generous, but I dare not believe you
there. Much that I did and all that I left unsaid
must have puzzled you. I wouldn't speak now, Sara,
if I didn't feel sure that in spite of my faults, my
stupidity, my want of self-knowledge, you saw that I
was destined to love you.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was impossible to deny this fact. She had been
well aware always of his affection, and the certainty
had given a peculiar emotional value to every scene&mdash;no
matter how commonplace&mdash;to every occasion, no
matter how crowded, to every conversation, no matter
how trivial&mdash;in which he figured or his name transpired.
He and poor Marshire were the two men in the
world who really loved her. Marshire was the more
desperate because he was less intelligent and had fewer
interests; Reckage loved her with all the force of a
selfish, vain, and spoilt nature. Such a passion she
knew was not especially noble and certainly not ideal.
But it was strong, and it made him submissive.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sara,&#8221; he said, &#8220;you have got to help me.&#8221; He
put his arm round her waist, and as she inclined her
face ever so slightly toward his, he kissed her cheek.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I help you?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us marry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't wish to marry any one just yet, Beauclerk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>&#8221;
she said; &#8220;I like my liberty. I don't feel that I
should make either a good wife, or a contented one, as
I am now. I want to see more and think more before
I give up my will to another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I would not ask you to give up your will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We should be utterly miserable if I didn't.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Believe me, it is the weak, effeminate creature
who wishes to control women. Men of character
respect women of character. These fellows who
declare that they will be masters in their own house
are masters nowhere else. I delight in your spirit.
Orange and I have often agreed,&#8221; he added, with a
searching look, &#8220;that you are the most brilliant girl
in England.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why do you quote Robert?&#8221; she said carelessly;
&#8220;isn't your opinion enough for me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you pretend that his opinion has no weight
with you?&#8221;</p>

<p>She laughed, and stroked his arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;My dear, why should I pretend anything? To
tell the truth, I am surprised that Orange has noticed
me. I saw Mrs. Parflete to-day. I understand his
infatuation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have always told you that she was a very pretty
woman. But why is it that, no matter where we
start, we always come back to Orange? I am getting
sick of him. I dislike being <i>affiché</i>, as it were, to
some one else. This marriage of his pursues me. If
I go into a club, if I dine, if I ride, if I walk&mdash;ten to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>one if I am not pelted with questions about Mrs.
Parflete, or Robert's history, or his genius, or his
future plans. I must drop him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Drop him?&#8221; she exclaimed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes. It doesn't help me to appear so friendly with
a Roman. I know he is very fine, but I have to consider
my own position. They all say that it would
be madness to take the chair now at his meeting.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But it was <i>your</i> meeting, Beauclerk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the first place, perhaps. I thought, too, it might
be a good, independent move. Disraeli's invitation to
Hanborough puts another complexion on affairs. It is
the first formal recognition that he, as Leader, has ever
given me. It is a reminder of my responsibilities.
He is fond of Orange, I know, and he wouldn't hurt
his feelings, or seem to put a spoke in his wheel, for
all the world. But Dizzy is subtle. He likes to test
one's <i>savoir vivre</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall you tell Orange that you intend to throw
him over?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, you ought!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why? I want the meeting to take place. It
will be useful in its way&mdash;it may show us how public
opinion is going.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sara hid her contempt by rising from her chair and
removing her hat. Reckage watched the play of her
arms as she stood before the mirror, and he did not see,
as she could, the reflection of his face&mdash;sensual, calcu<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>lating,
and, stormed as it was for the moment by the
meanest feelings of self-interest, repellent.</p>

<p>&#8220;How I hate him!&#8221; she thought; &#8220;how I despise
him!&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she turned round, smiling&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hats make my head ache! So you think the
meeting will be useful?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Emphatically. It did occur to me that I might
drop a line to Robert&mdash;in fact, I was writing to him
when you came in. Here's the letter, as you see,
signed and sealed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do send it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; he answered, putting it back into his pocket;
&#8220;one could only get him on the platform just now by
making him believe that such an action would, in
some way, help me. You don't know Robert.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I daresay not, but I know that much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This being the case, why upset him at the eleventh
hour?&#8221;</p>

<p>She made no reply, and before Reckage could speak
again, the servant announced the arrival of his horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;I intend to ride like the devil, Sara,&#8221; he said;
&#8220;and I wish you could come with me. What rides
we used to have&mdash;long ago! You were a larky little
thing in those days, darling!&#8221;</p>

<p>He bent down and kissed her lips.</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall marry me&mdash;or no one,&#8221; said he; &#8220;but
you are cold: you are not very nice to me. I suppose
it's your way. You wouldn't be yourself if you were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>like other women. You are not a woman, you're a
witch. Must I go now?&#8221;</p>

<p>Sara had opened the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, you know how Pluto hates to wait.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That animal will be the death of me yet. Will
you stand on the balcony and watch me till I am out
of sight? Have pretty manners&mdash;for once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well.&#8221;</p>

<p>She went on to the balcony, watched him mount,
and ride away. He turned several times to gaze back
at her picturesque figure, dim, but to him lovely in
the gathering dusk.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p><h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>


<p>Robert, after his interview with the priest, returned
to his old lodgings in a top floor of Vigo Street&mdash;for
he had left Almouth House, where Reckage's
hospitality, kind as it was, suited neither his pride
nor his mood. He was greatly in debt, and although
his salary from Lord Wight and his literary earnings
represented a sure income, it stood at what he called
the &#8220;early hundreds.&#8221; The tastes, habits, and pursuits
of those with whom he spent his time were delightful,
no doubt, but they were costly. A box at the
play; the cricket-match party, little dinners, and a
rubber of whist, or a quiet game of vingt-et-un;
the lunches here, the suppers there; the country
houses where, in the winter, one could dine and
sleep and hunt the next day, and, in the autumn,
shoot, and, in the summer, flirt; the attendance at
race-meetings, balls, and weddings; journeys to the
Continent, civilities everywhere,&mdash;in fact, the whole
business of society&mdash;no matter how modestly done&mdash;demands
money. Most young men are naturally
fond of brilliant, light-hearted companions, plenty of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>amusement, and that indescribable treasure known as
the <i>joie de vivre</i>. Orange was no exception to this
rule, and there were many hours when he tasted
the bitterness of poverty, and felt the harsh differences
between the outward gifts bestowed by Fate. It was
not that he cared for luxuries, but it seemed hard that
a horse should have to be counted among them, and
that it was necessary to work for twelve hours a day in
order to live at all, even as a dependent, among those
with whom he was, by right of birth and ability, the
equal, and to whom he was, in many cases, the superior.
How many promising careers and brave hearts have fallen
short under the strain of a position so mortifying and
apparently so unjust! In public life, whether one
joins the Church, the Camp, the Senate, or the
Arts, the trials of strength and courage are most
severe even to those who, in material circumstances
at any rate, are favourites of fortune. Neither
influence nor riches avail much in the terrific
struggles for supremacy, for recognition, for mere
fair play itself. What must the conflict be then
for those who, with slight purses and few allies, find
themselves pitted against the powerful of the earth?
Discouragement, in weak natures, soon turns to
envy, and the spectacle of human unkindness has
driven many a reflective, delicate soul to say that
the companionship of his fellow-men is unlovely,
not to be admired, and difficult, at times, not to
hate. In disgust of the world&mdash;where one has been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>wounded, or where one has wounded others&mdash;(wounded
vanity and remorse are alike bitter in their
fruits), numbers, with a sort of despairing fatalism,
retire from the campaign, cut themselves adrift from
their people and their country, and, having failed
in life, court death under strange skies in far-off lands.
Robert, who looked rather for the triumph of ideas
than the glory of individuals, was not easily dismayed.
So long as the right was by some means accomplished,
and good seeds brought forth a good harvest,&mdash;the burden
and heat of the day, the changes of weather, the
scantiness of the wage, the ingratitude and treachery
of agents, the hardships, the toil&mdash;mattered little
enough. Devoured by ambition in his early youth,
he had never permitted himself the least doubtful
means of attaining any object. He was not obliged,
therefore, to affect an indifference to success in order
to divert attention from his methods of arriving at
it. No man, once bent upon a project, could
be more resolute than Orange. None were more
stern in self-repression and self-discipline. But in
controlling, or subduing altogether, the softer possibilities
in a character, there is always the danger
lest uncharitableness, hardness of heart, or blind
severity of judgment should take their place. Young
people with strong natures can seldom find the middle
course between extremes, and this one, in curbing
a desire for power, will fairly crush his whole vigour,
while that one, in revolt against the tyranny of love,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>will become the slave of pessimism. There were
days, no doubt, and weeks when Orange found every
counsel, a mockery, and every law, a paradox. The
strife between the flesh and the spirit went on in
his life as it does in all lives, but he was one who
held, that, whatever the issue of it all might be, a
man must be a man while he may&mdash;losing himself
neither in the whirl of passion nor in the enervating
worlds of reverie, but accepting the fulness of existence&mdash;its
pains, vanities, pleasures, cares, sorrows,&mdash;with a
fighter's courage and the fortitude of an immortal soul.</p>

<p>As he walked along toward Vigo Street in the cold,
dark autumn morning, he felt more than able to hold
his own against all adversaries. And this was not
the insolence of conceit, but the just strength which
comes from a vigorous conscience and perfect health.
A soldier counts it no shame, but rather an honour,
to die in battle, so Robert, surveying the chances
before him, stood determined, in every event, to
endure until the end, to fight until the end, to
maintain his ground until the end. But if he had
put sentiment from his path, it was not so easily
weeded from his constitution, and while he was able
to persuade himself that his renunciation of all
passionate love&mdash;except as a bitter-sweet memory&mdash;was
complete, he had to realise that the old grudge
against Castrillon had grown into a formidable,
unquenchable, over-mastering hatred. Where this
strange obsession was concerned, no religious or other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>consideration availed in the least. Bit by bit, hour by
hour, the feeling had grown, deriving vigour from
every source, every allusion, and every experience.
The books he read, the conversations he heard, the
people he met&mdash;all seemed to illuminate and justify,
in some mysterious way, his enmity against Castrillon.
He may have believed that he was resigned to his
ill-luck in love, but a sense that he had been defrauded
haunted his thoughts always, and the longing to
square his account with destiny was less a wish than
a mute instinct. How great had been the temptation
to defy all laws&mdash;human and Divine&mdash;where Brigit
Parflete was in question, no one can know. In
getting the better of it, the motive had not been,
it must be confessed, the fear of punishment here
or hereafter. This would not be a true history, nor a
reasonable one, if it were not acknowledged that much
of the victory in that situation had been due to the
woman's youth and candid, sunny nature. No passion&mdash;far
less a guilty one&mdash;he thought, could have had a
place in that childlike heart. She was Pompilia&mdash;not
Juliet, because, like the more ill-starred heroine, she
had met sorrow before she met love, and the strong
emotion which comes first in a young life makes the
deep, the ineffaceable impression on its character.
She had the strength to suffer undeserved woe, but the
penalties of defiance and disobedience would surely kill
her. The thought of any desperate step seemed
impossible.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>
<p>The question of love at that point in Orange's life
had therefore been decided as much by conditions as it
had by principles and conscience. But with the Castrillon
difficulty, it was a question of hatred&mdash;not love.
In hate, Orange was as little given to brooding as he
was in other matters. He had never been able to
forgive the duel at Loadilla which had occasioned so
much scandal in Madrid, and brought Brigit's name
into bad company. Robert, before his meeting with
Mrs. Parflete, had fought several duels, and each of
them about a different pretty face. Encounters of
the kind form part of a youth's education on the
Continent: such experiences are considered not
romantic, not heroic, not striking, but merely usual
and manly. It was impossible for one brought up in
this view to feel that duelling&mdash;under certain provocation
and fair conditions&mdash;was wrong. The custom
was frequently abused, no doubt, yet the same could be
said of all customs, and Orange, rightly or wrongly,
held a conviction on the subject which no argument
could affect. But, with a lover's unreasonableness, he
had found the fight between Bodava and Castrillon an
insult to the lady at stake. He suspected, too, that
Castrillon had spoken lightly of her to General Prim,
to Zeuill, perhaps to d'Alchingen. This was insufferable,
and so, inasmuch as the mischief had been
done, he would not and could not remain outside the
combat. There seemed, also, a certain feeling at the
Clubs where the Madrid scandal had become known,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>that Castrillon, on the whole, had proved a more
dashing, and was probably the favoured, suitor.
Orange, whose personal courage had been demonstrated
too often to be called into doubt, had been
criticised for an absence of moral, or rather immoral,
courage with regard to Mrs. Parflete. Reckage's sly
phrases about the ecclesiastical temperament; the
sneers of some adventurous women on the subject of
platonic affection; the good-natured brow-lifting of
the wits and the worldly were not easy to bear for a
man who was, by nature, impulsive, by nature, regardless
of every sacrifice and all opinions while a strong
purpose remained unfulfilled. Robert made up his
mind that, come what might, whether his action was
approved or blamed, or whether he won or lost, pick
some quarrel he would, and see how Castrillon liked
it, and thus settle the matter then and for always.
Castrillon had received a military training; he was a
most adroit swordsman and a notorious shot; he would
not be one to make a quarrel difficult.</p>

<p>When Orange reached the house in Vigo Street, it
was still early in the day. As he mounted the stairs,
he noticed a fellow-lodger, still in his evening clothes,
entering a room on the second floor. He did not see
the man's face, but he was struck by something
familiar in his build. This impression was not haunting,
it passed almost immediately, and the young man
settled down with resolution to his work. At one
o'clock he went to Brookes's, had his lunch, met
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>a few acquaintances who studied his face with
curiosity, and a few colleagues who tried to persuade
each other that he was a man who could play a deep
game. He returned to his rooms and resumed work
till about six o'clock, when his landlord informed him
that a lady, who would not give her name, wished to
see him. The lady was tall, handsomely dressed,
darkly veiled. What, he thought, if it should be
Brigit? What joy! What rashness! Robert went
out into the hall to meet the strange visitor. She
made a gesture signifying silence, and, on greeting
her, he did not utter her name. It was Lady Sara.</p>

<p>She did not speak until she had entered the shabbily
furnished sitting-room and closed the door.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a mad thing on my part,&#8221; she said; &#8220;a
mad thing. I know it. Of course, I might have
asked you to come to me, but I couldn't wait so long.
And I don't trust letters. Some news can't be written.
It is not about Mrs. Parflete,&#8221; she added, hastily, &#8220;you
need not fear that. It is about Beauclerk. He came
to see me this afternoon. He is going to throw you
over. He is going to fail you at the Meeting. You
are to test public opinion while he sits under shelter&mdash;to
profit by your experience. What do you think
of that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are very good to come. But I hope you are
mistaken all the same. He may throw me over. I
am sure he will send me a word of warning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That was his first intention. He gave it up,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>because he knew you wouldn't act without him. And
he wants you to act&mdash;for the reason I have given.
Oh, I'm so ashamed, so humiliated to think that any
friend of mine could be such a traitor.&#8221;</p>

<p>She unpinned her veil, and seemed all the handsomer
for her scornful expression and flashing eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be the first to retire,&#8221; she continued.
&#8220;I won't have you treated in this contemptuous way:
I won't endure it. I want you to write to the Committee
at once&mdash;at once&mdash;without a moment's loss of
time. This is why I have come here myself. You
seem to have something in you which they take for
weakness. You will stand anything. Oh, I know
why well enough. You like to be a martyr&mdash;which
means saying nothing and suffering a good deal. But
I call it a mistake. I call it irritating, misleading,
actually wrong. If I were a man I would kill
people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is easy enough to kill.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So they say. Be more unscrupulous, dear friend.
Give your nature full play now and again. You can't
make me believe that you are ever natural.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Some can trust their natures. I don't trust
mine.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't you see how much more power you would
have over men if you were more emotional, more
spontaneous, more human? Who gives you credit
for self-control? No one. They say you are self-contained&mdash;a
very different idea. They say you are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>cold. Now, I don't care what I do. I follow every
impulse. I must follow them. I had to come here
this evening. I had to tell you about Reckage. The
landlord was odious. I met two men on the staircase.
One actually tried to peer into my face. I have never
submitted to such indignities. Heaven knows what
they are thinking now. I shall remember their vile
laugh as long as I live. But I was determined to see
you. And here I am. Apparently I have not done
much good by coming. You hardly believe me. You
think me an indiscreet woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you are splendid.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I saw Mrs. Parflete to-day. She is beautiful. But
she is indiscreet, too. All women worth considering
are miracles of imprudence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Haven't I always said so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then how can you expect us to like you when
you are so&mdash;so wise?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't expect you to like me.&#8221;</p>

<p>She bit her lip and pretended to check a laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you enjoy this room?&#8221; she said, glancing
round it till her eyes fell on a small crucifix which
was nailed to the wall behind his chair; &#8220;it is so
depressing. You are very perverse. And the odd
thing is&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what is the odd thing?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That you are attracted by Mrs. Parflete. Your
style ought to be Saint Clare or Saint Elizabeth. But
not at all. You prefer this exquisite, wayward, per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>fectly
dressed, extremely young actress. You give
your nature full play in your <i>taste</i>, at all events.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can urge that much in my favour, then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, that much. Oh, she's pretty. But frivolous
and light-hearted&mdash;as light-hearted as Titania. There!
I have been wondering what I could call her. She is
Titania in alabaster. Marble is too strong. At first, I
thought it might be marble. I have changed my
mind since. I suppose you know she will act in this
comedy with Castrillon at the d'Alchingens?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So Disraeli has told me. Did you come to tell
me that, also?&#8221;</p>

<p>She coloured, but met his angry glance without
flinching. &#8220;Now,&#8221; she thought, &#8220;he is going to
show temper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I came to tell you that, also,&#8221; she repeated. &#8220;Pensée
is opposed to the whole scheme. Mrs. Parflete stamped
her very beautiful foot, and said, &#8216;I go.&#8217; Do you
approve?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am to meet Castrillon to-night at the Prince
d'Alchingen's,&#8221; he answered, evading her question.</p>

<p>&#8220;How you hate him!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What makes you think so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know your face. I never saw any love there
for anybody, but just then there was a look of
hate.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are quite right. I do hate him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are actually trembling at the mention of his
name. Then you have feelings, after all.&#8221; She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>clapped her hands, and leaving her chair walked
toward him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never hate me, will you?&#8221; she said, touching
his arm. &#8220;Promise me that you will never hate me.
Like me as much as you can.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that instant, they heard a tap at the door, and
the landlord, carrying a few letters on a salver,
entered the room. Sara pulled down her veil&mdash;a
foolish action, which she regretted a moment later.
Orange thanked the man for the letters and threw
them on the table. The landlord, with a studied air
of discretion, which was the more insulting for its very
slyness, went, half on tiptoe, out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does he always bring your letters upstairs?&#8221; she
asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;As a rule&mdash;no,&#8221; said Orange.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he came on purpose! He wanted to see
me&mdash;what impudence! I am beginning to realise
what one has to expect if one&mdash;if one takes an unconventional
step.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice failed, and tears began to roll down her
cheeks. Then she covered her face with her hands.</p>

<p>&#8220;Every courageous&mdash;every disinterested act is unconventional,&#8221;
said Robert; &#8220;you are tired out&mdash;that's
all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You see,&#8221; she answered, with a note of harsh
sadness in her voice, &#8220;I have had a strange day.
The scene with Beauclerk was a great strain. I feel
a kind of apprehensiveness and terror&mdash;yes, terror,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>which I cannot describe. It may be my nerves, it
may be fancy. But I am too conscious of being alive.
Every minute seems vital. Every sound is acute.
This day has been one long over-emphasis. Look at
my hand: how it trembles! Beauclerk called me
a witch. Certainly, I am more sensitive to impressions
than most people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One of these letters is from Reckage. It is
written on a sheet of your own note-paper.&#8221;</p>

<p>She dried her eyes, and looked at him with exultation,
astonishment, and a certain incredulity.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he must have listened to me. He posted
it, after all, when he left the house. He is always
impulsive. I remember now&mdash;that I saw him give
something to the groom. Do read what he says.&#8221;</p>

<p>The letter, scrawled hastily on the pale lilac note-paper
affected by Sara and bearing her monogram, ran
as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">My Dear Old Fellow</span>,&mdash;There are still some points
of arrangement very material to consider with regard to this
Meeting next week, and I hope it is not too late to go
into them. The thing cannot be done away. But the
circumstances have become, thank God, very different
indeed. Mr. Disraeli has asked me to speak in his stead
at Hanborough&mdash;an honour so wholly unexpected and undeserved
that I am forced to see in it an especial mark of
encouragement. I must admit at once that I feel greatly
flattered. I am not now to be taught what opinion I am
to entertain of those gentlemen whose narrow and selfish
principles forced me to move against my inclination, my
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>judgment, and my convictions. I am persuaded that any
additional public action&mdash;no matter how indirect on my
part&mdash;in the Nomination of Temple would have at this
juncture, the worse effect. It would savour of self-advertisement&mdash;an
idea which I abhor. It would seem
an <i>over-doing</i>, as it were, of my own importance. You will
readily agree, I know, that I ought to keep perfectly quiet
before, and for some time after, my Hanborough appearance.
Not having in any degree changed my view upon
this subject of the Association, I don't feel that my present
decision is inconsistent. I think it will strike everybody
as a sensible&mdash;the only sensible&mdash;course to follow.</p>

<p>&#8220;When can you dine? Or if you won't dine, let me
see you when you can spare half an hour.</p><p class="i8 nospaceabove">&#8220;Yours affectionately,&#8221;</p><p class="i20 nospaceabove">&#8220;<span class="smcap">Beauclerk</span>.&#8221;</p></blockquote>

<p>Orange turned to Sara and said, when he had
finished reading&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad he wrote.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew him better than I did. He is still a
poor creature, for, what does it all come to?&mdash;a
rambling, stupid lie. The letter is sheer rubbish&mdash;a
complete misrepresentation of the facts. But I need
not have come. This always happens when women
interfere between men,&#8221; she added, bitterly; &#8220;you
don't want us. There's a freemasonry among men.
You excuse and justify and forgive each other always.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You persuaded him to post this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true. He might have done so, however,
without persuasion. In future, call me the busybody!
I must go now. I have made you late for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>d'Alchingen's dinner. What a lesson to those about
to make themselves useful! And how right you were
not to get bitter! I take things too much to heart.
I must pray for flippancy. Then, perhaps, I may
find no fault with this world, or with you, or with
anybody!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am bitter enough&mdash;don't doubt it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No! no! let us assure each other that this is
the best of all possible worlds&mdash;that Beauclerk shows
cleverness and good sense, that no one tells lies, no one
is treacherous, no one is unjust, malicious, or revengeful
nowadays, that friends are friends, and enemies&mdash;merely
divided in opinions! We must encourage
ourselves in a cynical, good-natured toleration of all
that is abject and detestable in mankind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are too impatient, Lady Sara. You want
life concentrated, like a play, into a few acts lasting,
say, three hours. Whereas, most lives have no
dénouement&mdash;so far as lookers-on are concerned!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At last some one has been able to define me.
I am &#8216;impatient.&#8217; But you take refuge in that profound
silence which is the philosophy of the strong;
you don't struggle against the general feeling; you
content yourself by going your own gait quietly.
You have pride enough to be&mdash;nothing, and ambition
enough to do&mdash;everything. Hark! what is that?
They are calling out news in the street.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The current lie,&#8221; said Orange. &#8220;We don't want
to hear it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Sara walked to the window and threw it open.</p>

<p>&#8220;I caught a name,&#8221; she exclaimed. &#8220;It is something
about Reckage ... Listen ... Reckage!&#8221;</p>

<p>Above the din of the traffic, a hoarse duet rose from
the street&mdash;voice answering voice with a discordant
reiteration of one phrase&mdash;&#8220;<i>Serious accident to Lord
Reckage! Serious accident to Lord Reckage!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;My God, what are they saying? What are they
saying? It is my imagination. It can't be true. I
am fancying things. What are they saying?&#8221;</p>

<p>Orange had already left the room and was in the
road. When he returned, he gave her the newspaper
and did not attempt to speak. But he closed the
window in order to shut out, if possible, the hideous
cry.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is it? I can't see! In which column?&#8221;
said Sara.</p>

<p>He pointed to a corner on the third page, where
she read in black, rough type:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Lord Reckage was thrown from his horse at Hyde
Park Corner this afternoon. He was removed to
Almouth House. His injuries are said to be of a very
dangerous nature.</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>She crushed the paper in her hand, and the two
stood looking at each other, stupefied by the blow.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to him,&#8221; said Robert.</p>

<p>&#8220;And I must go home,&#8221; whispered the girl. &#8220;He
always said that Pluto would be the death of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>They went down the stairs together without ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>changing
a word. Orange walked with her to St.
James's Square. Neither could speak. On parting,
she faltered,&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me know ... how he is....<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>


<p>Lord Reckage had been carried through the hall
of Almouth House, but not up the famous staircase of
which he was so proud. He looked at it as they bore
him to the library, and although he was still in a kind
of stupor, the terrified servants could read in his eyes
the certain knowledge that he would never behold the
marble walls or the portraits of his ancestors again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you in pain, my lord? is your lordship in
pain?&#8221; sobbed the housekeeper. His features were
injured and his face was perfectly pallid&mdash;so much
changed that he could not have been immediately
recognised. Four doctors&mdash;one of them a passer-by
at the time of the accident&mdash;had assembled. They
found one shoulder was severely injured, and the right
collar-bone broken. He complained of great pain in
his side.</p>

<p>&#8220;Am I going to die, Sir Thomas?&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why should you die?&#8221; replied the distinguished
surgeon. &#8220;But you have had a nasty fall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pluto shied at something,&#8221; answered his lordship;
&#8220;mind they don't shoot him. I won't have him shot.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, for a few moments, he lost consciousness.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>
<p>When Orange arrived, the physicians were looking
very grave, and telegrams had been despatched to all
the young man's near relatives.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has called for you several times,&#8221; said Sir
Thomas; &#8220;and,&#8221; he added, dropping his voice, &#8220;is
there any lady who could meet ... the family? I
fancy I caught a lady's name more than once. Could
it have been&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;Sara,&#8221; suggested Orange, to relieve his embarrassment.</p>

<p>&#8220;It certainly sounded like Sara.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I will send Lord Garrow a note&mdash;she is
Lord Garrow's daughter&mdash;a lifelong friend. Is there
no hope?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He may have a pretty good night.&#8221;</p>

<p>Robert bowed his head and asked no more. He
sat by the dying man, whose sufferings, although they
were a little alleviated by morphia, made him restless.
He moaned even in his snatches of sleep, and spoke
occasionally&mdash;always about the accident. Once he
mentioned Agnes:</p>

<p>&#8220;Agnes will be sorry when she hears.&#8221;</p>

<p>Toward daybreak he turned to Orange, and said
quite simply&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are different from the rest. You have the
priest's element in you; there is an incessant struggle
and toil to cut one another's throat among us average
men&mdash;all striving after success. You weren't built
that way. God bless you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>In the morning his father and the near relatives
arrived. The women cried bitterly. The aged peer
looked on in stony grief&mdash;drinking in his son's scarred
faced and glancing, with despair, from time to time,
at the clock.</p>

<p>&#8220;It isn't going, is it?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>No, it had been checked; the tick disturbed his
lordship, but there was an hour-glass on the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;How many hours do they think&mdash;&mdash;?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps ten hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>When the sand had run down at the conclusion of
the first hour, no one reversed the instrument. But
Lady Margaret Sempton, the Earl's sister, sent a
whispered message to the Bishop of Hadley, who was
waiting, much altered by sorrow and anxiety, in the
ante-room. Reckage had asked to see him. He had
always liked the good old man, and the rest withdrew
during their short interview.</p>

<p>Meanwhile carriage after carriage drove up to the
door; caller after caller appeared with cards, notes,
and inquiries; name after name was inscribed in the
visitors' book; telegrams came from the Royal family,
from all parts of the country and the Continent.</p>

<p>&#8220;My poor boy. I didn't know he had so many
friends,&#8221; said his father. &#8220;God forgive me, I used to
think he wasted his time on fads.&#8221;</p>

<p>And odd people came also. Trainers, jockeys,
and horse-dealers rubbed shoulders on the doorsteps
with collectors of old furniture, missionaries, election<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>eering
agents, ladies of the chorus, of the <i>corps de ballet</i>,
shabby-genteel individuals of both sexes out of work,
and the like; each had his degree of regret and an
anecdote.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was always very kind to me,&#8221; said this one,
that one, and the other.</p>

<p>Bradwyn, noting some of these unusual visitors,
observed that Reckage had a knack of pleasing the
lower classes and half-educated persons generally. He
heard a Bible-reader say to the footman: &#8220;<i>Take ye
heed, watch and pray; for ye know not when the time
is!</i>&#8221; and he shuddered at this exhibition of bad taste.
Lord Garrow had been unremitting in his personal
inquiries, but Sara did not come till she received the
following from Orange&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is conscious, and he asks to see you.&#8221;</p>

<p>She reached the room as the Bishop of Hadley was
coming out; tears were in his eyes and he did not
notice the young lady who glided past him as lightly
as a shadow. Poor Reckage recognised her step, however,
and pulled the sheet half over his face lest she
should be startled at its harsh disfigurements. She
threw off her hat and veil and fell on her knees by the
side of his bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;Speak to me, Beauclerk, speak to me; it is I&mdash;Sara.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know you,&#8221; he whispered; &#8220;you are the one I
loved the best. But I haven't been true to anybody.
I only wish to goodness I had another chance. I'd be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>different&mdash;I'd show 'em ... I never meant ...&#8221; he
took her hand, her beautiful, tapering hand loaded
with sapphires ... &#8220;like your eyes, old girl ...
don't cry ... and I say, I posted that ... letter
after all ... to please you. Are you ... pleased?&#8221;</p>

<p>He spoke no more.</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>Action is the essence of political parties, and the
members of the League had the ink barely dry on
their telegrams of condolence before they despatched
others, summoning a special meeting for the consideration
of future steps. Orange, who was regarded
as a man devoid of ambition, was unanimously elected
a member of the Executive Committee; he was a good
speaker, he could mind his own business, he never
pulled wires, and it was his rule to step aside when
others behind him showed any disposition to push
toward the front. On the evening of the day on
which Lord Reckage died, Aumerle and Ullweather
called at Vigo Street as a preliminary move in their
new plan of campaign. But Robert was not there.
He sat all that night, a solitary watcher, in the chamber
of death. His affection for his old pupil was something
stronger than a brother's love. Whether he
saw him as others saw him, or whether he was aware
of certain pleasant traits in that uncertain character
which escaped the common run of dull observers, his
devotion had never wearied in all the years of their
acquaintanceship.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span></p>
<p>The old housekeeper crept into the room when
the bereaved family had retired, and she was on her
way to bed.</p>

<p>&#8220;You and me, sir, always got on with his lordship,&#8221;
she said, looking down, with Robert, at the still,
marred face. &#8220;We understood him. He wasn't all
for self&mdash;as many thought. But his heart wanted
touching. If you could touch his heart, a kinder
gentleman didn't live. And if it was my last breath,
I'd call him the best of the lot&mdash;in spite of his
tantrums, and his changeableness, and his haughty
way sometimes. Mark my words, the glory of
Almouth dies with him. Mr. Hercy will bring us
down to rack and ruin. O, sir, I'm glad I'm old.
I never want to see the sorrow that is sure to come to
Almouth.&#8221;</p>

<p>But Orange was not thinking about the house of
Almouth, or its fate. His thoughts were with the
soul of the young man who had enjoyed life so
well, and made so many plans, and cherished so
many worldly hopes&mdash;of the young man who had
existed apparently to indulge his own will, spend
money, kill time, and fulfil a few rather showy responsibilities.
And yet what Robert remembered best was
his laugh. He could hear it still.</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span></p><h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV</h2>


<p>Prince d'Alchingen had been much put out of
conceit with himself by disappointment. The small
dinner which he had carefully arranged for Orange
and Castrillon took place, but Orange was not present.
He had sent word from Almouth House that he
could not leave Lord Reckage. His Excellency,
therefore, was thoroughly annoyed, and Castrillon's
persiflage fell heavily upon his ears. He tried to
think that this nobleman's vivacity made him appear
flippant, whereas he was, in reality, a Don Juan of
the classic type&mdash;unscrupulous, calculating, and damnable.
When he remarked that it was <i>grande folie de
vouloir d'être sage avec une sagesse impossible</i>, the Prince's
spirits rose&mdash;only to fall again, however, at a later
pronouncement from the same lips to the effect
that virtuous women always brought tears to his
eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;They tell me,&#8221; said the Prince, weighing each
syllable with great deliberation (they carried on their
conversation principally in French and Spanish) &#8220;that
Mrs. Parflete is an admirable actress.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>Castrillon kissed the tips of his fingers to the air,
and ejaculated: &#8220;Adorable!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Does she resemble, in any way, I wonder, her
good mother, Madame Duboc?&#8221;</p>

<p>No, she had her own style&mdash;although she was
coquettish enough. And pretty? Delicious.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is better,&#8221; thought his Excellency, &#8220;much
better. And do you think,&#8221; he asked, aloud, &#8220;that
she cares at all for Orange?&#8221;</p>

<p>Castrillon smirked and put his hand, half instinctively,
to his breast-pocket. D'Alchingen inferred,
from this quick movement, that he carried a letter
or two, or a keepsake, from the lady near the region of
his heart.</p>

<p>&#8220;She may need the tonic of some Platonic love
in order to bear the burden of a solitary life,&#8221; said the
Marquis; &#8220;but, all the same, I have no especial
reason to think that M. de Hausée is her ideal.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is the ideal of several persons,&#8221; said Alchingen;
&#8220;I don't know what to make of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>But at this point Castrillon displayed a maddening
discretion. The Prince was glad when he took his
departure, and he exhausted his stock of malice in
wishing the young coxcomb to the devil. His
Excellency was becoming more and more morose over
his snuff and the last mail&mdash;which was longer and
duller than usual&mdash;with a peculiarly sharp note from
his Chief into the bargain&mdash;when Mudara was
announced.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span></p>
<p>Mudara bowed to perfection, and then, going
forward, presumed to put his hand on the Ambassador's
arm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Your Excellency,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I have some important
news. On the whole it is gratifying. It
may make us cynical, but it is absurd to expect human
nature to be Divine. Mrs. Parflete has been at
Orange's lodgings this afternoon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don't mean it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Indeed, it is too true. When he moved to Vigo
Street, I was fortunate enough to secure a room in
the same house immediately under his.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was sitting at my table, with the door just ajar,
when I heard, at six o'clock, a rustle of silk skirts on
the stairs. I peeped out. I saw a tall lady, thickly
veiled, following our landlord, Dunton, across the
landing. She caught sight of me, and started
violently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was it Mrs. Parflete?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I could <i>swear</i>&#8221; he answered slowly, &#8220;that it was
Mrs. Parflete.... She reached Orange's door;
Dunton tapped; Orange came out; the lady and
he exchanged glances; they entered the room together,
and he closed the door. Three-quarters of an hour
later they came down the stairs and left the house.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You followed them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alas! I couldn't. I was not alone. Parflete
himself was with me. I dared not trust him out of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>my sight. He, following his custom, grew faint at
the sight of Madame&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then he, too, recognised her? This is excellent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He recognised her height and her figure. Besides,
whom else could it have been&mdash;if not Mrs. Parflete?
M. de Hausée has no sister, and we know his character.
The caprice of fortune has honoured him
with many faults, but gallantry is not among them. I
have that from those who knew him when he was too
young to disguise his true nature. He would not have
been an <i>abbé malgré lui</i>, and he has, on the contrary, the
most ecclesiastical soul I know. Rest assured, your
Excellency, that this <i>canaille</i> of a woman is determined
to be his ruin, for she is a baptized serpent,&mdash;one of
those creatures more dangerous to men than the devil
himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Ambassador smiled agreeably, put his tongue in
his cheek, and nodded his head with a movement
which might have passed equally well for a sympathetic
reproof or sorrowful acquiescence.</p>

<p>&#8220;What will Parflete do?&#8221; he asked.</p>

<p>Mudara threw up his dark, sinewy, and powerful
hands in genuine despair.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is the vice of the situation,&#8221; he exclaimed; &#8220;at
the very mention of divorce his teeth chatter, he gets
a spasm of the heart, and he begins to gabble like a
sick monk about his soul and his conscience. Believe
me, we are dealing with a madman. How can any
end be attained in his present state of irresolution?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Happily it is not my business either to arrange or
propose the means.&#8221;</p>

<p>The sly glance of the Prince encountered the sly
glance of the Agent.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is well understood, your Excellency,&#8221; said
Mudara, with the inimitable accent of respect. &#8220;Let
good be done and let evil be avoided, is the sum total
of the Government's desires. But whenever I can see
clearly, I shall know how to act. When right and
truth are plain, time and experience are the best allies.
We have at least sufficient evidence to institute divorce
proceedings. If Parflete will not file a petition&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can do nothing. Unless you can be perfectly
sure that he will follow some reasonable course,
he ought to be saved from himself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he ought to be saved from himself. Something
in my nature makes me follow a certain kind of
man as hounds track game. What is now to be done
is to meet force with force.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;An armed diplomacy is good,&#8221; said d'Alchingen.</p>

<p>&#8220;And also a scheme of alternatives,&#8221; replied
Mudara.</p>

<p>&#8220;I confess I very much prefer working through
Castrillon, if possible, than de Hausée. Disraeli has
implicit faith in this de Hausée. It seems taken for
granted that he is ascetic and intellectual. He is
altogether in the clouds, whereas Castrillon is wholly
in touch with&mdash;with humanity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But de Hausée, like the Cardinal de Retz, fought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>duels when he was a student. If I cannot work upon
Parflete's jealousy, we must see what can be done in
that direction with de Hausée. We hear much of
the soul's awakening! Wait for the body's awakening
now&mdash;it must come. Mrs. Parflete is a <i>Samaritaine</i>;
we have to prove it somehow. Even though one
invented stories about her, one would probably find
that they were, approximately, true.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Keep me informed,&#8221; said the Prince, making a
little bow, which signified that the audience was at an
end.</p>

<p>Mudara, according to his own Confession, left the
Embassy and proceeded at once to the small private
hotel near Covent Garden where Parflete had taken up
his abode.</p>

<blockquote><p>Parflete's rooms, (<i>we read</i>) were en suite. He had
bought a few rather beautiful prints and a number of
exquisitely bound books. These last, with bowls and
vases of flowers, were scattered over the various tables.
The scent of the flowers mingled with the strange fumes
of some Oriental incense. He had draped pieces of
flame-coloured silk over the windows. Everything looked
<i>bizarre</i>, and the atmosphere was sultry. When I entered
he was not pleased to see me&mdash;in fact, he showed a disposition
to sulk. I laboured to convince him that he
would forfeit the respect of all honourable men unless
he showed some just resentment at his wife's conduct.</p>

<p>&#8220;No one respects me as it is,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;nobody
cares what I do one way or the other so long as I avoid
the police. And as the police and I have nothing at all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>in common, I am not likely to give offence to my good
friends in the Alberian Government.&#8221;</p>

<p>I warned him that such sneers were unjustifiable, and
I reminded him, with severity, of the Government's
extraordinary forbearance.</p>

<p>He fixed his eyes unpleasantly upon me, and his fingers
trembled as he played with the frogs of his lilac-velvet
smoking-jacket.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that you would mind your own
business. I have done everything to protect the appearance
of your good faith all through this affair. Now leave
me alone. Besides, I can't be sure that the lady we saw
to-day was Her Imperial Highness.&#8221;</p>

<p>My exasperation at his tone of defiance was all but
uncontrollable.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know,&#8221; said I, &#8220;that we had no doubt of her
identity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We didn't see her face nor the colour of her hair. In
any case, I refuse to humiliate her. Kindly remember
that she is my wife, and drop a conversation which I find
insulting.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hot words then passed between us. In my anger I
may have uttered several truths which hit him too hard.
Suddenly he sprang at me as though he were a wild cat.
His eyes rolled, his face was convulsed beyond recognition.
Men I have never feared; he seemed, however,
not a man but some demoniac risen from hell. In
self-defence I struck him with the small poniard which I
have carried all my life. He staggered back, and the
blood-letting seemed to relieve his temper.</p>

<p>&#8220;Go!&#8221; said he; &#8220;go while you can. I don't think the
wound is mortal, but I don't wish any man hanged for
murdering me.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was in my will to strike him again. I was beside
myself with contempt at what I took to be a fresh revelation
of his cowardice.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span></p>
<p>I replied coolly enough,&mdash;&#8220;I would not murder you.
Have no alarm on that score. But I can defend myself,
I hope.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time he had reached the door and thrown it
open. A waiter was passing at the time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sir,&#8221; said Parflete, &#8220;I have the honour to wish you
good-day.&#8221;</p>

<p>The waiter heard this remark distinctly, and saw me
bow as I parted from the wretched creature.</p>

<p>Parflete's appearance was ghastly, but I attributed this
pallor to fright and not to pain, for I believed from my
heart that the wound was no more than a slight prick. I
left the hotel, took a cab to my lodgings, and after reading
a light Spanish novel in order to change the current of
my thoughts, I passed an excellent night, sleeping at least
seven hours.</p></blockquote>

<p>Lord Garrow, after much cautious consideration,
had decided that Lady Sara could not absent herself
from the d'Alchingens' party without exciting
unfavourable comment, and so prejudicing her future
relationship with the Duke of Marshire. His lordship,
in his secret heart, was by no means sorry for Reckage's
untimely death. An orthodox faith in a better,
happier world assisted his conscience over the many
difficulties which afflict a strong sense of good
manners. Good manners demanded some show of
grief at the young man's melancholy end; but, as his
lordship pointed out to his weeping daughter, higher
reflections ought to triumph over the vulgar instincts
of sorrow, and an etiquette almost heathenish. &#8220;Let
us be thankful,&#8221; said he, &#8220;that poor Beauclerk was
spared some lingering malady and the shattering
disappointments of a public career. He would not
wish us to mourn. And indeed, any undue mourning
on your part might give a very false impression in
society. You must go to the d'Alchingens'.&#8221;</p>

<p>Hadley Lodge was built in the reign of George I.
In design it resembles a little the Vice-Regal Lodge in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>Dublin; two wings, containing innumerable small
rooms, are connected by corridors leading to the
entrance hall. The chief rooms are in the centre, to
which Prince d'Alchingen himself added a miniature
theatre, copied from the one at Trianon. When
Sara arrived, the Prince and Princess were taking tea
in the gallery&mdash;an apartment so furnished with screens,
sofas, writing-tables, divans, and arm-chairs that it had
become the lounge, as it were, of the house. Less
formal than the saloon, brighter than the library, and
more airy than the boudoir, the Princess spent the
greater part of her day in a favourite corner where she
could command a view from four windows, enjoy the
fire, see the best pictures, and hear the piano pleasantly
if any guest chose to play upon it. In person she was
tall and rather gaunt, with high cheek-bones, and very
dark hollows under her eyes. She had the air of a
mourning empress, and seriousness was so natural to
her countenance, that, although she could not smile,
and had never been known to laugh, she was not
depressing nor was she, accurately speaking, melancholy.
The style of beauty&mdash;for she had beauty&mdash;was
haggard, of the kind now familiar to all English
people from the paintings of Sir Edward Burne-Jones.
In 1869, however, this type was still highly uncommon
and little appreciated. Journals and letters of the
period contain references to &#8220;that fright, Princess
d'Alchingen,&#8221; or &#8220;that poor creature who always looks
so ill,&#8221; or &#8220;that woman who makes one think of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>corpse.&#8221; Sara admired the Princess, and surprised all
the fashionable artists of that day by insisting on her
paintableness.</p>

<p>&#8220;How good of you to come, dear Sara!&#8221; she
murmured, presenting her sallow cheek to the
young girl with a touch of regal graciousness at once
designed and impulsive; &#8220;I should have been lost
without you. Anselm has invited a large party, and,
as you know, I cannot talk to these dear people.
I find them too clever, and they find me too stupid.
The world is not willing to give me credit for that
which I have done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And what is that, dearest?&#8221; asked the Prince.</p>

<p>&#8220;I married you!&#8221; she answered, with a quick flash
of humour under her gravity. It was like the
occasional sparkle in granite. &#8220;You may smile at the
notion of my living on the reputation of what I might
yet do,&#8221; she continued, resuming her languor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us talk of pleasant things only, <i>chère amie</i>,&#8221;
said the Prince, turning to Sara; &#8220;mind you, not a
word about graves and epitaphs. Mrs. Parflete has
arrived. Castrillon has arrived. You need not
trouble about the others. They are not&mdash;they cannot
be&mdash;worth your while. But do watch Castrillon. I
find that the greatest compliment he can pay to any
woman is to sneer at her expense. He never permits
himself the slightest epigram against those who have
erred in kindness toward him. One witty but frail
lady once implored him to miss no opportunity of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>abusing her in public. &#8216;Otherwise,&#8217; said she, &#8216;they
will know all.&#8217; Isn't that a good story?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anselm!&#8221; sighed the Princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder who that lady was?&#8221; said Sara.</p>

<p>&#8220;I dare not guess,&#8221; said the Prince.</p>

<p>Sara had recovered from the emotion called forth
by Reckage's tragic fate, and she was living now in
one of those taciturn reveries which had become more
and more habitual with her since the last interview
with d'Alchingen. Every force in her passionate,
undisciplined soul was concentrated in a wild love for
Orange, and every thought of her mind was fixed on
the determination to win his affection in return.
There were only two real powers in the world, she
told herself; these were moral force and money.
Money could not affect Robert. But he was susceptible
to moral force. She resolved to display such an
intrepid spirit, such strength of will, such devotion that
Brigit would seem a mere doll in comparison.</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you think,&#8221; she said, turning to the
Princess, &#8220;of Mrs. Parflete? Your opinion is worth
everything. Orange is infatuated with her. His
criticism is therefore useless. The Prince disapproves
of her parentage. He is therefore prejudiced. I wish
to be charitable. I, therefore, say what I hardly think.
Pensée Fitz Rewes is an innocent little fool. She
judges all women by herself. You, Princess, are an
angel of the world. Your verdict, quickly.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Princess paused before she attempted any reply.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span>Then she fixed her deep, grey eyes on Sarah's excited
face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I like her,&#8221; she said, slowly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that all?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think she is immature for her age, and therefore
reckless. She knows everything about sorrow,
and very little&mdash;at present&mdash;about happiness. So she
doesn't seem quite human. She shows that indulgence
toward others which is perhaps the last degree
of contempt for the follies of humanity. Those who
take their neighbours seriously are almost invariably
severe. Mrs. Parflete, on the contrary, is all good-nature
and excuses. I believe she has genius, and I
am sure she will have an amazing career.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Princess, who had always insisted on a studious
rather than an active part in life, was consequently
unlike the majority of her sex, who, in the bustle
of social engagements, talk without ceasing, letting
words take the place of ideas, and phrases serve for
sentiments. All that she uttered showed a habit
of thought opposed to the common method of
drawing-room conversation; she rarely said the
expected thing, and never, a welcome one. Sara,
therefore, was disappointed at this favourable judgment
of Mrs. Parflete. The jealousy which she had been
able to control by hoping, in the depths of her
heart, that the young actress would prove too light
a creature to bind for long any masculine, stirring
spirit, now saw some justification for vehemence.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;And what do you think of Robert Orange?&#8221; she
asked, breathing quickly.</p>

<p>The Princess folded her hands, fixed her eyes again
on the young girl, and answered in her usual even
tones&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a sentimentalist turned man of action.
When this miracle can be accomplished, you may
expect a very decided, even implacable, character&mdash;because
it is much more difficult to crush one's poetry
than to crush one's passions. The passions are more
or less physical, they depend on many material
conditions or accidents; but poetry, ideals, romance
and the like belong to the spirit. I find a great
campaign is being waged everywhere against the
soul. It is a universal movement&mdash;the only things
considered now are the pocket and the brain and
the liver.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Delightful!&#8221; said Sara, trying to speak calmly;
&#8220;and will Orange become a liver-devotee?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You don't understand self-discipline, <i>chérie</i>,&#8221;
answered the Princess; &#8220;that seems a sealed mystery
to most people except the Catholics and the Buddhists.
Protestants never speak of it, never think of it.
Their education is all for self-concealment. If I
read M. de Hausée rightly, he will become no
colourless, emasculated being, but certainly a man
with a silent heart. When he has a grievance he
will take it to God&mdash;never to his friends.&#8221;</p>

<p>Prince d'Alchingen stifled a yawn and offered Sara
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>a cigarette, which she refused, although she had
acquired the habit of smoking during her visits to
Russia.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you will both swear,&#8221; said he, &#8220;to keep a
secret, I can tell you one.&#8221;</p>

<p>The old and the young lady flushed alike with
delight at the prospect of hearing some strange news.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will come well,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;after my
wife's prophetic remarks. Mrs. Parflete went alone
to Orange's lodgings on Wednesday last at six
o'clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it possible?&#8221; exclaimed the Princess.</p>

<p>Sara, feeling the Prince's dissecting glance burning
into her countenance, grew white and red by turns.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a temperament! what jealousy!&#8221; thought
d'Alchingen.</p>

<p>&#8220;How do you know all this?&#8221; she asked, thrusting
her hands, which were trembling, into her ermine
muff.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it for a fact. The question now is&mdash;How
will Parflete endure such conduct? Her bigamy
may have been innocent, or at least, an unavoidable
accident. But the afternoon call&mdash;well, if he can
swallow that, his meekness runs a risk of being called
cowardice, and his magnanimity will bear an unpleasant
resemblance to dishonour.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yet surely&mdash;surely&mdash;&mdash;&#8220; stammered Sara.</p>

<p>In a second she grasped the mistake which had been
made, and all its possible disastrous consequences to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>herself. Loss of reputation, the finger of scorn, and
for what? Nothing, or at the worst, an indiscretion.
Scandal, had there been a romantic cause, and loss
of reputation, had there been a great passion to make
it more memorable as a sacrifice than a disgrace,
would have seemed to her defiant mind something
glorious. But here was a mere unbeautiful story&mdash;sordid,
if misunderstood, and a little silly, if satisfactorily
explained. And it could not be satisfactorily
explained. Sara knew life too well to encourage
herself by supposing that the real truth about her
foolish visit to Orange's lodgings could ever be told
or believed. Orange himself would never betray her
she knew. But what if she had been seen or
recognised? The landlord, the men on the staircase&mdash;had
they followed her home, or been able to pierce
through her thick veil? She tried to collect her
thoughts, to appear extremely interested&mdash;that was
all. The effort, however, was beyond her strength.
She showed her agitation, and, while it was fortunately
attributed by the d'Alchingens to a wrong reason,
they were close observers of every change in her face,
nor did they miss the notes of alarm and nervousness
in her voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will probably mean a divorce, the social ruin
of Orange, and the successful <i>début</i> of Madame as
a comedian of the first rank,&#8221; said the Ambassador.</p>

<p>&#8220;Does Orange know that she was seen that day?&#8221;
asked Sara.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Not yet. He will know soon enough, never
fear.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you sure&mdash;quite sure that it was Mrs.
Parflete?&#8221; suggested the Princess.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have been she,&#8221; replied the Prince.</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have been she,&#8221; repeated Sara, mechanically.</p>

<p>The lie seemed to come before she had time to
think of it; it tripped off her tongue as though some
will, other than her own, controlled her speech.
But now that the untruth was spoken she determined
to abide by it, so she repeated:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must have been Mrs. Parflete.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And suppose,&#8221; said the Princess, &#8220;that she is able
to prove that she spent the whole of Wednesday with
Lady Fitz Rewes? No one could doubt the evidence
of Lady Fitz Rewes.&#8221;</p>

<p>D'Alchingen shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;In that event&mdash;which is unlikely,&#8221; he said; &#8220;M.
de Hausée will have a bad half-hour with Mrs. Parflete.
The idyll will be spoilt for ever, and our pretty tale
for angels about a Saint and a little Bohemian will
sink to its proper level. It always takes three to
make a really edifying Platonic history. The third
in this case is the lady who called at Vigo Street.
<i>Dans le combat, il faut marchez sans s'attendrir!</i>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who would live?&#8221; murmured the Princess,
pressing a martyr's relic which she always wore on
a chain round her neck.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Suppose,&#8221; continued d'Alchingen, enjoying his
own cynicism, &#8220;that we have a quartette in this
instance. Madame has her Castrillon, M. de Hausée
has his veiled lady. Each is a pious fraud to the
other. Imagine the double current of their thoughts,
the deceit, the hypocrisy, the colossal lie behind them
both which makes the inspiring truth a fact! It
is an anecdote to be told in the Boccaccio manner&mdash;gracefully,
with humour, with much indulgence ...
otherwise, it might be the sort of story they tell
in hell.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am happy to say that I have no imagination,&#8221;
said the Princess; &#8220;and now I shall take Sara&mdash;who
must be tired&mdash;to her room.&#8221;</p>

<p>She rose from her seat, and, drawing Sara's arm
through hers, walked from the gallery, through the
hall, and up the staircase, talking, the while, of a new
Romney which the Prince had recently purchased.</p>

<p>Sara was now in her own room, but not alone,
for her maid was unpacking, and the gown, petticoat,
shoes, gloves, and flowers designed for that evening
were being spread out upon the bed. The girl was
in no humour to enjoy the finery which she had
chosen with so much delight. She turned her back
upon it all, and, pulling up the blind, gazed moodily
out of the window till her maid's preparations were
at an end. Romantic trees and a landscape, almost
artificial in its prettiness, surrounded Hadley. The
sun was setting in a fire, burnishing with enamel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>tints the long green hills which ranged as a natural
fortification across the horizon, shutting out a whole
country of flat fields beyond. The moon, in its first
quarter, shone out above a distant steeple where
the eastern sky, already blue and opalesque, promised
the dawn of another day in reparation for the one
then dying in scarlet splendour. But to those who
are unhappy, to-morrow is a word without significance.
Sara stretched out her arms instinctively toward the
coming night. She wanted darkness and she wanted
sleep&mdash;not the stars of the morning, not the joy of noon.
What should she do? Her mad love for Orange
had reached a desperate point&mdash;a point where she
realised all too clearly and with bitterness, that, so
far from being a source of strength, it was a curse,
a malady, a humiliation&mdash;driving her into that insatiable
desire of solitude where the companionship
of dreadful imaginations and gloomy thoughts can
rend the soul at their pleasure. As men are sometimes
lured toward dangerous perils on land, or
mountains, or by sea, and from thence to deeds,
discoveries, and crimes unforeseen and unpremeditated,
so she seemed borne along into a whirlpool of feelings
which chilled the better impulses of her nature
and accentuated, with acid and fire, every elementary
instinct. Animal powers and spiritual tendencies
alike were concentrated into one absorbing passion
which reasoned only in delirium, incoherently, without
issue. She was wretched in Orange's company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>because every moment so spent showed her that
his heart was fixed far indeed from her. But the
wretchedness suffered that way was stifled in the
torments she endured when she wondered, miserably,
in loneliness, what he was thinking, doing, saying;
where he was, with whom he was, and how he
was. The despair of unrequited love was thrice
intensified by jealousy. &#8220;Why did he like that
little adventuress, that white china Rahab?&#8221; she
asked herself again and again. &#8220;It is just because
she has bewitched him. It is not real love&mdash;it
isn't any kind of love. She cannot care for him
as I do. It isn't in her. O why, why does he fight
so hard against me?&#8221;</p>

<p>Beautiful women seldom believe that their charms
can be resisted without a fierce struggle. It was,
in fact, a tranquil consciousness of beauty which gave
audacity to Sara's words, and put the ordinary question
of pride out of the question. Was it not rather a
case of the goddess putting on humanity, of the queen
condescending to a subject. <i>La reine s'amuse</i> was
the unuttered, constant motto on her heart of hearts.
The blood of Asiatic princes ran in her veins, and
a sovereign contempt for manners, as opposed to
passions and self-will, ruled her fierce spirit. But
what should she do? A moment's reflection had
shown her that Brigit could have no difficulty in
proving that she was not the mysterious lady who
visited Orange's lodgings. Having weighed all the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>disadvantages, Sara now directed her attention to the
advantages she could snatch out of the dilemma.
At last she hit on a bold plan. She rang a bell and a
housemaid answered the summons.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is Mrs. Parflete in her bedroom?&#8221; asked Lady
Sara; &#8220;and where is her bedroom?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Her bedroom is next to yours, my lady. She is
in there now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sara walked along the corridor till she reached an
oak door on which was a card bearing the name she
sought. She tapped, and heard Brigit herself reply&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;Come in.&#8221;</p>

<p>The young actress was lying, in a black silk
dressing-gown, on the sofa. Her hair fell loosely
to her shoulders, and she had evidently been fast
asleep, for her cheeks were less pale than usual, her
eyes were bright, and the happiness of some pleasant
dream still lingered in their expression.</p>

<p>&#8220;Lady Sara&mdash;how good of you to come!&#8221; she
exclaimed; &#8220;I have been trying to rest. I want to
play well this evening.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will play beautifully, of course,&#8221; said Sara,
submitting, even in her jealousy, to the charm and
grace of her unconscious rival. &#8220;I have come on
a difficult errand,&#8221; she added, abruptly; &#8220;you may
not understand, but I hope&mdash;I believe&mdash;you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>She became so pale as she uttered these words that
Brigit leant forward with a gesture of reassurance.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>In spite of her fragility she was, from the habit of
self-control, a stronger spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;You may be sure that I shall understand,&#8221; she
said.</p>

<p>&#8220;Forgive me, then, but some enemy has circulated
a report that you went to Mr. Orange's rooms in
Vigo Street last Wednesday.&#8221;</p>

<p>A deep flush swept over Brigit's face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I was not there,&#8221; she said.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know,&#8221; said Sara. &#8220;I know you were not
there. They made a mistake. It was I they saw&mdash;not
you&mdash;it was I.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brigit dropped her eyes but made no other movement.
She seemed to grow rigid, and the hand
which had been playing with the fringe of her girdle
remained fixed in its arrested action.</p>

<p>&#8220;You? It was you? How &mdash;&mdash; you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I had to see him. So I went to him. Now he
can easily deny that you were there. But he won't
betray me. People must think what they please.
But I am telling you&mdash;because you, at least, ought
to know the truth.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And yet it is not my business!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What do you mean? Not your business?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can it be my business to ask what lady
went to&mdash;to his lodgings?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you would have wondered&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I should have wondered. I could not have
helped that.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Orange and I have been friends, as you
know, for some time. He knew me years ago before
he&mdash;he met you. I was quite a little girl. I remember
I used to hold his hand when I walked in
the gardens by his side.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He has often spoken of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But all this does not help us now. If it were
ever known that I&mdash;I was the one, the other day,&mdash;I
should be ruined.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You may be sure that no one shall know.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not so selfish as I seem. I don't forget that
this story will injure him&mdash;injure him terribly. They
will think him a kind of Joseph Surface&mdash;a hypocrite.
People expect him to be different from everybody
else. A piece of gossip which they would have laughed
at and taken as a matter of course from poor Beauclerk
or Charles Aumerle&mdash;they would resent bitterly in
Robert. The thing that grieves me, that torments
me, is the fear lest this act of mine may injure
him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It won't injure him,&#8221; said Brigit. &#8220;Have no fear
at all. And if you went to see him, as you say, you
must have had the best of reasons for doing so. You
may rely, I am sure, on his keeping your name a
secret. You were kind to tell me&mdash;for he certainly
would not have told me&mdash;without your consent. We
never see each other now, and we never write to each
other.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her voice trembled for the first time.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;How does he look?&#8221; she asked, after a sharp
struggle between her pride and a desire to hear
more.</p>

<p>&#8220;He looks ill and worn. He over-works.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He will suffer at Lord Reckage's death.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But he hides his feelings. He is always reticent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;O, to see him and talk with him&mdash;that would be
such a joy for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You must be very sad, often,&#8221; said Sara, coldly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, often,&#8221; answered Brigit. &#8220;And I was so
happy during the short time we were together that
now it seems no part of my life&mdash;no part of it. I
say this because I wish you to know that nothing
can make us love each other less&mdash;that all this misery
and separation&mdash;which may last as long as we live&mdash;has
made no difference and can make no difference
to us. And if I never see him again, or speak to him
again, he will always be certain that I am his&mdash;unalterably,
for ever his.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are little more than a child. You have a
great career before you&mdash;who can say what may
happen in the future? Women without careers
change their minds&mdash;their tastes. These things are
out of one's own control, and in your case&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;My mind may change, but my soul cannot. I
may dance, I may amuse myself, I may have friends.
Make no mistake. I can tell you all that is in me.
I find life beautiful. The theatre enchants me.
I could work there all day. I have no illusions about
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>it&mdash;the paint, the machinery, the box-office, the
advertisements&mdash;the vulgarity are familiar enough to
me. But I find a box-office, and machinery, and
vulgarity everywhere, though they are called by
other names.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sara coloured and looked away.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am getting stronger now,&#8221; continued Brigit.
&#8220;I can lift up my head and see the world as it is.
I like it&mdash;yes, with all its griefs and its horrors&mdash;I
like it. When one is ill or sentimental one hates
it, because it wasn't made for the sick, and it was
not created us a playground for lovers. One may
love&mdash;yes, but one must work. I intend to love and
work at the same time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Many find that these two occupations clash!
There is a time in love&mdash;just as there is a period
in life&mdash;when it seems enough in itself. It is
independent of circumstances and persons. O, but
that time soon passes! As you learn more, you look
for more. And work is no cure for dissatisfaction.
If you can live through it you will just be a machine
with one refrain&mdash;&#8216;I know nothing! I have
nothing! I am nothing!&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>The two young girls did not look at each other.
Brigit could recognise an agitation of the soul in the
imperceptible sadness of the voice, and she guessed
poor Sara's secret.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; she said quietly. &#8220;I must suffer all that.
How can you be sure that I have not suffered it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>already? At any rate, I hope this confidence will
increase your kindness toward me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have no kindness toward you&mdash;none at all,&#8221;
said Sara. &#8220;I have no kindness toward any living
creature. I should like to die and come to an end.
I wasn't born to put up with make-shifts. Other
women may be resigned to that paltry way of existing.
If they can't have what they want, they will take
what they don't want; they will take what they hate,
and grin&mdash;yes, they will grin and bear it. And after
a little while, because they become gradually drunk
with suffering, they begin to think they are noble.
They are not noble. They are fools, fools, fools!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan't accept make-shifts,&#8221; answered Brigit. &#8220;I
intend to keep all my ideals, but they are all unfinished
at present. I have just the outlines and beginnings of
them&mdash;nothing else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not talking about ideals. I am speaking of
realities. I don't want to be happy, but I do wish to
be one of four things: either perfectly alive, or perfectly,
utterly dead; either a pure spirit, or a faultless
animal. This dead-and-alive, body-and-soul
mixture which passes for a well-disciplined human
being is loathsome to me. It is a tissue of lies and
hypocrisies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps I should have that feeling, too, if I had
no faith in God. He assumed humanity&mdash;not despising
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You know I do not believe that splendid story<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>&mdash;so
it doesn't help me. I compare life as I feel
it with life as it is, and the inequality fills me with
disgust. The example of Christ is too sublime.
He was human only in His sufferings. He bore
our burdens and He shared our agonies. He was
deceived, despised, rejected: the first torture and
the firstfruits of His Passion was the treachery of
a disciple. When I am sorrowful and wretched,
He seems Real to me and vivid. But when I
am well and wildly happy, He seems far away and
unreal&mdash;an invisible God, watching mortals with
a certain contempt. Now the Pagans had a
Divinity for every mood, so they never felt depressed
or lowered in their own self-esteem. We have a God
for two moods only,&mdash;great sorrow, and great exaltation.
For the rest we have to beat our breasts and
call ourselves miserable sinners. All the good people
I know enjoy spiritual peace only&mdash;without any fear
of remorse&mdash;when they are tired out or moaning with
physical pain. I don't say this to shock you; I
should like to have a religion if I could be convinced
of it without fasting, without long illnesses, and without
abandoning all hope of earthly, common joys.
Most Christians take a middle way, I know; they
prattle about their immortal souls, and behave as
though they had nothing but bodies. I can't take
part in such a gross farce.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brigit sighed deeply, and did not reply at once.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is all very hard, I know,&#8221; she answered; &#8220;but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>from the lowest abyss one can still see the sky overhead.
People's hearts are touched by the spectacle
of sin or the spectacle of suffering. Our Lord could
not sin, therefore He reached our sympathies by
His Death and Sorrows. Of course, if this life here
were all, and this world were the only one, and we
were animals with less beauty than many of the
inanimate things in nature, and as much intelligence
at best as the bees and birds and ants&mdash;then the Pagan
way might be quite admirable. But this isn't the
case, and so&mdash;and so&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>Sara laughed.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are a grotesque compromise between gods
and creatures,&#8221; she said; &#8220;those of us who find this
out get a little impatient with the false position.
You are less sentimental than I am. You take what
I call the hard view. It is too frigid for me. But I
am making you late. All good luck to-night!&#8221;</p>

<p>She waved her hand, and, returning to her own
room, realised that she had missed the object of her
conversation. The attempt to excite Brigit's jealousy
had failed.</p>

<p>Nothing is so infectious as despair. Brigit sat
quivering under the echo of Sara's last words: &#8220;You
take what I call the hard view.&#8221; Was it, then, such
an easy matter to bury love in perpetual silence, to
let nature yield to fate, to stifle every human craving?
The mention of Robert's name and the news that
he looked ill and careworn had stirred all the unshed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>tears in her heart; she could not think, she could not
move, she could but realise that she had no right
to be with him. And sorrow seemed her province.
There, surely, she and he might meet, join hands, and
speak once more face to face. She had not written to
him since that parting at Miraflores. But she would
write now. This was her letter&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">My Dearest Life</span>&mdash;You are my dearest and you are my
life&mdash;so let me say it now, even if I never say it again. I
could be glad (if any gladness were left in me) at your grief
for Lord Reckage's death, because it gives me an excuse
for breaking my word and writing to you. This is selfish,
but nobody knows how much I have suffered, or how
much I suffer daily, hourly. I try to believe that it
would have been worse if we had never owned our love,
never met again after our first meeting. Darling, I can't
be sure. Sometimes I wish I had been born quite numb.
I dare not complain, and yet it is impossible to feel
contented. Always, always there is a dreadful pain in my
heart. Every moment is occupied, for when I am not
working, I sleep, and when I wake, I work. I would
rather spend one perfect day with you and die, than
live on without you. This is the truth. If I had any
choice that would be my choice. But I know you want
me to be courageous, and I myself want you to see that
a woman's love can be as strong as a man's. Women are
supposed to make men weak&mdash;they are supposed to be
chains and hindrances. This shan't be said of me. You
wouldn't say it: you wouldn't think it: yet in history
I find that while a few have been saved by women, more
have been ruined by them. And where the women have
saved the men they loved, it has been done by great
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>renunciations and sacrifices&mdash;not at all by selfishness and
joys. When I can remember this (I forget it too easily),
I can almost persuade myself that I don't long to see you,
to hear your voice, to be with you again on the boat&mdash;going
on and on toward Miraflores. But I never persuade
myself of this entirely&mdash;never, never. I do long to see
you, Robert: I do want to be with you. I envy the
servant in your lodgings, and the friends you meet.
And I&mdash;who love you so dearly&mdash;may not go near you. I
am going to act to-night&mdash;as if I were not acting all day,
every day! I haven't said one word about you. But you
couldn't be so wretched as I am, because <i>you</i> have yourself,
<i>you</i> know what you are doing, saying, and thinking. Now
if I could cease altogether and become, say, your hand or
your foot, no one would expect you to renounce me. I
might be useful, and it would certainly be no scandal
if I accompanied you everywhere! I won't say any
more.</p><p class="i16 nospaceabove"><span class="smcap">Brigit.</span></p></blockquote>

<p>She addressed an envelope and sealed the letter
within it. Then, with tears streaming down her
cheeks, she read her part for the comedy that evening.
When Esther entered with her dressing-gown, she
held up her hands in dismay.</p>

<p>&#8220;O Madame,&#8221; said she, &#8220;I thought you were going
to play an amusing piece!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be very amusing,&#8221; said Brigit, &#8220;but this
is the way to rehearse it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>


<p>The Marquis of Castrillon, meanwhile, was pirouetting
sublimely before the long mirror in his dressing-room,
while his valet, a sour-faced individual, looked
on in great but gloomy interest. The Marquis was
superbly dressed in a Louis Seize costume&mdash;an exact
reproduction of the one worn by that monarch on his
wedding-day&mdash;and he presented a very fine figure.
In features, expression, colouring, and manner it
would have been difficult to find, or imagine, a
more fascinating puppet. An unsurpassable actor of
noble parts, he seemed created to play the hero
in deeds, the poet in thoughts, the lover on all
occasions. Confident of his attractions, he appeared
quite free from vanity: each fresh attitude became
him better than the last: no light could do less than
show the classic beauty of his head and body. When
he laughed, one could admire his magnificent teeth;
when he looked grave, one could enjoy the splendid
serenity of his brow and the passion in his deep brown
eyes. It was said that his legs alone would have made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>the plainest man a dangerous rival, that his well-cut
mouth would have made a monster irresistible.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you don't think,&#8221; said he, as he executed a
final bow and kicked off his shoes because a buckle
stuck into his instep&mdash;&#8220;so you don't think, Isidore,
that Her Imperial Highness loves me?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know she doesn't,&#8221; replied his man. &#8220;I am
not going to say that I see more than I see.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may be that she cannot love,&#8221; said the Marquis,
&#8220;and I don't think less of her on that account. These
sentimental girls become very monotonous and sickening.
The women whom men love the longest are prim,
stand-off women. Have you noticed that, Isidore?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I haven't noticed that. I haven't noticed
much love lasting long for any kind of person.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There's something in your stupidity which refreshes
me. I have a strong notion to marry Her
Imperial Highness. I could make her happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I tell you I could. She has the oddest effect
upon me. No other woman has ever affected me in
such a way. I feel when I am with her as though
we were well matched. If I were a King, I would
make her my Queen. I might love others, but I
should always say, &#8216;Remember the Queen. The
Queen must be remembered, and honoured, and
obeyed in all things.&#8217; Sometimes I see myself&mdash;with
her&mdash;at a kind of Versailles: every one standing up as
we enter: Her Majesty very pale and tall and won<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>derful
in a blue velvet robe and pearls, I would
adore her with a passion as constant as it was respectful.
I should ask in return <i>une amitié la plus tendre</i>.
Isidore, she is an angel. The sweetness of her soul
is in her face&mdash;in the very sound of her voice. I
am a little too material to be so sublime in my sentiments
as M. de Hausée, but I could be unusually
faithful to that charming, beautiful creature. Isn't
there a crease under my left arm? Hold the glass
for me.&#8221;</p>

<p>Isidore held the glass while Castrillon, with knit
brows, studied the back view of his coat.</p>

<p>&#8220;The coat is perfect,&#8221; said Isidore; &#8220;you have
no heart or you would never find fault with such
a back.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you call me heartless?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I couldn't call you anything else,&#8221; replied the
valet, bluntly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why have you been with me, cat-fish, ever
since I was born?&#8221;</p>

<p>The Marquis had a stock of names for his servant,
none of which he employed unless he felt in a good
humour. Owl-pig, hog-mouse, ape-dog, rat-weasel,
and cat-fish were the highest expressions of his amiability
toward the man who had been his ill-tempered,
dishonest, impudent, and treacherous attendant all the
years of his life.</p>

<p>&#8220;You know, mule-viper,&#8221; he continued, &#8220;that no
one else would keep you for five minutes. You are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>a liar, a thief, and a traitor. Yet I endure you. I
agree that I must be either heartless or an idiot to put
up with such a rogue.&#8221;</p>

<p>Isidore grew livid, muttered blasphemies under his
breath, and put pink cotton-wool in the toes of his
master's dancing-shoes. Castrillon then kicked him
into the adjoining room and resumed his gymnastic
exercises. At the end of half an hour, the man re-entered
carrying a note fastidiously between his left
thumb and forefinger.</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that for me?&#8221; asked the Marquis, who was in
the act of turning a double somersault with much
agility.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is for Monsieur.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then read it aloud while I stand on my head.&#8221;</p>

<p>Isidore tore it open and began to read as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>Do not misjudge me</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stop!&#8221; exclaimed Castrillon, falling upon his feet
at once; &#8220;that is from a woman. Why didn't you
say so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is from Madame Parflete,&#8221; replied Isidore.</p>

<p>&#8220;Impossible!&#8221; said Castrillon, snatching it from his
hand; &#8220;impossible!&#8221;</p>

<p>He read the letter, flushed to the roots of his hair,
and kicked Isidore for the second time.</p>

<p>&#8220;You beast!&#8221; said he; &#8220;where did you get this?
It is her writing, but she never wrote it&mdash;never on
God's earth! Where did you get it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was given to me by one of her servants.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why the devil do you tell me such lies?&#8221; exclaimed
the young man in a fury; &#8220;it's some d&mdash;&mdash;d practical
joke in the most infernal bad taste, and, by God!
I have a mind to shoot you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Castrillon was not given to the utterance of vain
threats, and his anger was so great that the wretched
Isidore, shaking, whining, and cursing, edged round
the room with his back to the wall and his eyes fixed
on his master.</p>

<p>&#8220;Stand still, will you?&#8221; continued the Marquis;
&#8220;I want to hear a little more. How much were you
paid for giving me this twaddle? Answer me that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two guineas!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Two? I'll bet you had twenty. Stand still, I tell
you, or I'll kick you again. Do you expect me to
believe that Mrs. Parflete's servant gave you twenty
guineas?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I don't,&#8221; answered Isidore. &#8220;I don't expect
you to believe anything. But if that isn't Madame
Parflete's writing, whose writing is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just what I mean to find out,&#8221; replied
Castrillon, &#8220;and that is why I won't shoot you till it
suits my convenience.&#8221;</p>

<p>Isidore, who had a venomous attachment to the
Marquis, burst into tears. For many generations
their respective ancestors had stood in the relation,
each to the other, of tyrant and dependent. Isidore's
father had robbed, cheated, deceived, and adored
Castrillon's father; the fathers of these two reprobates
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>had observed the same measure of whippings and
treacheries, and so it had been always from the first
registered beginnings of the noble and the slavish
house. But an Isidore had never been known to leave
a Castrillon's service. The hereditary, easy-going forbearance,
on the one hand, which found killing less
tedious than a crude dismissal, and the hereditary
guilty conscience, on the other, which had to recognise
the justice of punishment, kept the connection
rudely loyal.</p>

<p>&#8220;I detest you,&#8221; said Castrillon; &#8220;I hate the sight
of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Isidore blubbered aloud, and accepted the information
as a turn for the better in the tide of his master's
wrath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who gave you that letter?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, if you must know, it was Signor Mudara.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mudara? Then Mudara wrote it. I'll wring his
neck.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I'll wring his neck, too&mdash;if he has tried any of his
games on me,&#8221; sobbed Isidore. &#8220;But it may not be a
game. You are always so hasty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Castrillon read the letter through once more.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can't believe that she wrote it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I'll
swear she didn't.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And why?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because the style is not in keeping with her
character, blockhead! She does not ask me&mdash;or any
one else&mdash;to visit her at two o'clock in the morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>A revolting smile made the valet's loose-hanging,
sullen lips quiver with emotion.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, that is not Madame's style. She is too clever.
But does that affect the opportunity!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What opportunity?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have the letter. It is for Madame herself to
deny the handwriting&mdash;not you. Why should you, of
all people, think it a joke? Why not act upon it?
Why not ask her what it means?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At two in the morning? I have no wish to
compromise Madame&mdash;not the least. She is too rich
to compromise. She is the sort of lady one marries.
Tell Mudara, with my compliments, he must understand
gentlemen before he can play successful tricks
upon them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will take my oath that I am not sure it is a
trick,&#8221; answered Isidore.</p>

<p>Castrillon studied the letter for a third time.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here and there,&#8221; he said, &#8220;it has the ring of her
voice, and the words are the words she uses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;With such a justification in my pocket, I know
what I should do,&#8221; mumbled Isidore.</p>

<p>&#8220;So do I. But you are the scum of the earth, and
what you would, or wouldn't do, could only interest
the hangman.&#8221;</p>

<p>The Marquis locked the note in his dressing-case,
and handed his keys, with his usual simplicity, to
Isidore.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not propose to tire myself with this nonsense
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>before the play,&#8221; said he. &#8220;Get my raw eggs and
milk.&#8221;</p>

<hr style="width: 45%;" />

<p>At nine o'clock that evening, a brilliant company
were gathered in the Salle de Comédie. Most of
the Foreign Ambassadors, and about fifty illustrious
personages of great social importance, were present.
Prince d'Alchingen had resolved that the daughter of
Henriette Duboc should have every opportunity of
making a successful <i>début</i> in England. He had
sprinkled most judiciously among his guests a few accredited
experts in various departments of knowledge,
and these he hoped would lead appreciation into the
right channel by explaining, at fit intervals, just why
Mrs. Parflete was beautiful and just where her art had
its especial distinction. The play itself&mdash;<i>La Seconde
Surprise de l'Amour</i>&mdash;by Pierre de Marivaux, was quite
unknown to the audience. Brigit and Castrillon had
appeared in it at Madrid, and descriptions of their
success were whispered through the room. The story
of her birth, her unhappy marriage, her adventures in
Spain, and her relations with De Hausée had quickened
curiosity to the highest pitch. Was she really so
young? was she really so pretty? was she going on
the public stage, or would she remain an accomplished,
semi-royal amateur? No one referred openly to the
late Archduke Charles, but the facts that Madame
Duboc had been his Canonical wife, that Mrs. Parflete
was the one child of their union, kept the whole
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>aristocratic assembly thrilled with the sense of taking
part in something as distinguished as a Court function,
as exciting as a Court scandal, and as bewildering as a
Court conspiracy. A string orchestra&mdash;conducted by
Strauss himself&mdash;played French melodies of the
eighteenth century. Would there be any dancing?
would she sing? Henriette Duboc had been compared,
as a dancer, to La Guimard, said Sir Piers
Harding to the Duchess of Lossett. And who was
La Guimard? asked the Duchess. And was Mrs.
Parflete at all like her mother? And did she bear the
extraordinary resemblance, <i>of which so much had been
made</i>, to Marie Antoinette? Sir Piers felt bound to
own that the likeness was remarkable. And this de
Hausée&mdash;what of him? Had Sir Piers seen the odd
announcement, about his name and antecedents, in the
<i>Times</i>? The Duchess didn't know what to think. It
was all so very odd, but most interesting, of course.
Was M. de Hausée, by any chance, in the audience?
No. Well, perhaps it was better taste on his part to
keep away. The bell rang. All eyes turned toward
the blue satin curtains; they moved: the lights were
lowered; the violins played a languorous air: with a
rustle&mdash;not unlike that caused by the movement of
wings&mdash;the curtains were drawn back and disclosed an
empty garden. Then, following the stage direction,
the Marquise entered &#8220;<i>tristement sur la scène</i>.&#8221; The
entrance was made quietly, and, for a breathless
second, no one realised that the heroine of the evening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>had at last appeared. Her Grace of Lossett began to
fear she felt a little disappointed when, in the nick of
time, a great poet, who sat near her, murmured,
&#8220;Divine.&#8221;</p>

<p>But at this point we may quote from the <i>Memoirs</i>
of Lady Julia Babington:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>Mrs. Parflete's personal appearance caused an immediate
furore. Many disagreed about her claims to perfect beauty,
but these hostile feelings did not last longer than five minutes.
She was an extremely pretty woman; rather tall for her
slight proportions, but elegant to a surprising degree. The
extraordinary charm of her acting, her voice, her countenance,
and her accent were delightful. It would have been impossible
to display more grace, simplicity, and ingenuousness than
she did: she gave several touches of pathos in a manner to make
one cry, and to quite enchant all who bad taste enough and mind
to appreciate her inimitable talent.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>And again in the Letters of Charlotte, Lady
Pardwicke, we read:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>If Mrs. Parflete can be called handsome, it is certainly a
</i>figure de fantasie<i>. She has a clear complexion, is young,
tall; her manners are </i>doucereuses<i>, for, besides being a beauty,
she has pretensions, I understand, to </i>bel-esprit<i>. The majority
of those present were undeniably captivated by her peculiar
fascination.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Augustus Barfield has the following remarks in his
famous Journal:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p><i>There were no two opinions about the success of the
</i>débutante<i>. We had been led to expect a good deal, but
fortunately every description proved inaccurate, so, while she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>utterly failed to realise any single preconceived idea, she had
the great advantage of appearing as some one wholly new.
Rumour had prepared me equally for a St. Elizabeth, a
Mademoiselle Mars, a Marie-Antoinette, a Récamier, or a
Sophie Arnould. She resembled none of these ladies&mdash;being far
more tragic in her nature than the rather sensual Queen of
France, and she is clearly an uncommon individual in her own
right. The women will squabble about her looks; the men will
have views about her figure: all must agree that her fortune on
the stage is assured. A more pleasing performance I never saw.
Love, innocence, tenderness, grief, joy, petulance, uncertainty,
modesty, despair&mdash;every feminine attribute, in fact, showed to
admiration in her expressive features. Voice, bewitching.
Gestures, exquisite. All, in fact, was truly enjoyable. I
would not have missed the evening on any account.</i></p></blockquote>

<p>Orange, it is true, had not joined the general company.
But Prince d'Alchingen for reasons of his
own, however, had offered the young man a seat in
the one small box which had a gilded <i>grille</i> before it
and was so made that it seemed part of the massive
decoration.</p>

<p>&#8220;You cannot be seen,&#8221; said the Prince; &#8220;I won't
tell her that you are present; and I give you my word of
honour that I won't tell anybody&mdash;not even my wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>The temptation was irresistible. Robert accepted
the invitation, and as he watched the play, it seemed
to him that he had never known Brigit till that
evening. He had seen her in dreams&mdash;yes; and
talked to her in dreams, yes; but now at last she
lived&mdash;a real creature. Lost in the part, she was able
to throw aside the self-restraint which had given her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>always a cold, almost sexless quality. Her face
betrayed a hundred changing emotions: the youth,
strength, and passion so severely repressed in her own
life came out, though still controlled, with full and
perfect harmony in her art. It was one of those
consummate revelations of temperament which, in
silent or inactive lives, never come till the last
hours before death&mdash;when in one look or one utterance
all the time lost and all the long-concealed
feelings take their reparation from existence. But
with those who may express their true characters
through the medium of some creative faculty, the
illuminated moment comes at a psychic crisis&mdash;not
to enforce the irony of death but to demonstrate and
intensify the richness of humanity. The knowledge
which depends upon suffering, and, in a way, springs
from it, is good, yet it must always be incomplete.
Happiness has its light also, and in order to get the
right explanation of any soul, or to understand the
eternal meaning of any situation, one must have had
at least a few glad hours, felt the ecstasy of thoughtless
joy, drifted a little while with the rushing,
unhindered tide. As Robert, behind the <i>grille</i>,
watched the animated, beautiful girl who seemed to
typify the very springtime of the world, he felt he
had peered too long at love and life through bars.
He would have to break them, get on the other side,
and join in the dazzling action. How unreal and
far-away seemed all grief, remorse, or anxiety from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span>that brilliant scene! Brigit was laughing, singing,
dancing&mdash;fulfilling, surely enough, her real vocation.
What! at seventeen, was she to sit pale, silent, tearful,
and alone? At his age, was he to look on&mdash;with
a dead heart and unseeing eyes, murmuring words of
tame submission to a contemptuous Fate? His
whole nature rose up in revolt, and the self he had
once abdicated rushed back to him, howling out
taunts which were not the less bitter because they
were false. Not pausing to wonder whether the
present were a profanation of the past, or the past an
insipid forecast of the present, he was conscious only
that a change&mdash;perhaps a terrible change&mdash;had taken
place in his mind&mdash;a change so sudden and so violent
that it had paralysed every power of analysis and
reflection. Imaginative love&mdash;made up of renunciation
and spirituality, gave way to the fierce desire to live,
to silence the intolerable wisdom of the conscience,
and learn folly for a space. He was madly jealous of
Castrillon, who gazed into Brigit's eyes and uttered
his lines with the most touching air of passionate
devotion. She seemed to respond, and, in fact,
their joint performance had that delicate, irresistible
abandon&mdash;apparently unconscious and unpremeditated&mdash;which
is only possible between two players who are
not in love with each other. Where there is actual
feeling, there is always a certain awkwardness and
want of conviction (partly caused by the inadequacy
of the diagram in comparison with the reality), and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span>the charm, so far as art is concerned, is wholly lost.
An acted love was the only love possible between
Brigit and Castrillon; hence its sincerity on the
stage, where, as a merely assumed thing, it harmonised
perfectly with its artificial surroundings&mdash;the
canvas landscape, the painted trees, the mechanical
birds, and the sunlight produced by tricks of gauze
and gas. But Orange did not stop to consider this.
It was enough and too much to see his &#8220;sad spirit of
the elfin race&#8221; completely transformed. Was this the
child-like, immature being of their strange visit to
Miraflores? That whole episode seemed a kind of
phantasy&mdash;a Midsummer Night's music&mdash;nothing
more, perhaps something less. The very title of the
play&mdash;<i>The Second Surprise of Love</i>&mdash;carried a mocking
significance. Sometimes the soul speaks first, sometimes
the senses first influence a life, but the turn,
soon or late, must inevitably come for each, and the
man or woman, sick of materialism, who begins to
suspect that the unseen world and its beauty is an
inheritance more lasting and more to be desired than
all the vindictive joys of this prison-house, has no
such bitterness as the idealist who finds himself
brought into thrilling touch with the physical loveliness,
the actual enchantment, the undeniable delight
of certain things in life. The questions, &#8220;What have
I missed? What have I lost? What birthright
have I renounced?&#8221; are bound to make themselves
heard. They beat upon the heart like hail upon the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>sand&mdash;and fall buried in the scars they cause. Things
of the flesh may and do become dead sea fruit; but
things of the spirit often become stale and meaningless
also. What is more weary than a tired mind?
What joys and labours are more exhausting than
those of the intellect, and the intellect only? Does
an idle week in summer ever beget more lassitude or
such disgust of life as a month&mdash;alone with books&mdash;in
a library? Dissatisfaction and satiety, melancholy
and fatigue show as plainly in the pages of à Kempis
as they do in Schopenhauer, as they do in Lucretius,
as they do in St. Bernard, as they do in Montaigne,
in Marcus Aurelius, in Dante, in St. Teresa. They
are, indeed, the ever-recurrent cries in human feeling,
the ever-recurrent phases in human thought. Uninterrupted
contentment was never yet found in any
calling or state; the saints were haggard with combats;
sleep, the most reposeful state we know, has its
fearful sorrows, hideous terrors, pursuing uncertainties.
Robert's spirit, stimulated by jealousy, played round
these reflections, common enough at all times, but, as
all common things, overwhelming at the first moment
of their complete realisation. The original frame of
his mind joined a defiance of formal precedent and an
intense openness to every fine pleasure of sense with
an impatience of all that makes for secrecy and an
abhorrence of the substitutes which are sometimes
basely, sometimes madly, accepted in default of true
objects. He could not desire the star and find solace
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>in the glow-worm&mdash;pursue Isolde and lag by the way
with Moll Flanders. It was true that he had resolved
to put stars and Isolde alike from his life. It was true
that he had bound himself to certain fair ambitions
beyond the determinations of calculation and experience.
It was true that he had resolved to sacrifice
this world to the next. He knew the claims which
the world to come has upon us. But did he know
the world he was renouncing? How that doubt
opened the way to further doubts! Was he a fool
for his pains? Was an enfeebling and afflicting of
the natural man so necessary to the exaltation of the
soul? Was the soul in itself so weak that it could
only rest decently in a sick body? Could it only
wish for something greater than this earth can give
by being artificially saddened?</p>

<p>Such questions have their answers, but they do not
occur very readily to young men hopelessly in love
and half out of their wits with jealousy. He might
have taken refuge in prayer, but at that moment he
did not want to pray. He wanted to think about
himself, to be himself throughout the entire reach of
his consciousness, to lose himself in the tempest of
emotion which seemed to drive out, beat, and shatter
every hindrance to its furious sweep. A smouldering
fire is for a while got under, and yet by suppression is
but thrown in, to spread more widely and deeply than
before. So his fatal affection, perhaps pitilessly
fought down in the first instance&mdash;asserted its power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>&mdash;its
power for evil. Not to love was not to live. He
was dead while he lived. He could not find peace in
an invisible world of which he did not see any more
even a shadow round about him. <i>Shall not the day of
the Lord be darkness and not light? even very dark, and
no brightness in it?</i> He did not believe that. What
miserable scruples to torment, blind, and pollute the
soul! Pascal has written that there are thousands
who sin without regret, who sin with gladness, who
feel no warning and no interior desire not to sin.
They doubted, hated, loved, acted, felt, and thought
just as they pleased. Perhaps they were not happy,
but if they received the punishment of wrong-doing,
the wrong at least was committed out of fetters and
joyously. It is not until men find themselves assailed
by a strong wish that they perceive how very still and
very small, all but inaudible, the still, small voice
can be. A moment comes when one ceases to think&mdash;one
wills, and if one is able and the will is sufficiently
determined, the purpose is carried into effect.
Temptations to steal, to lie, to deceive, to gamble, to
excess in drink and the like cannot approach a certain
order of mind. But the craving for knowledge and a
fuller life&mdash;either in a spiritual or the human way&mdash;is
implanted ineradicably in every soul, and while it
may rest inert and seem nullified in a kind of apathy,
the craving is there&mdash;to be aroused surely enough at
some dangerous hour. And of all the dangerous
hours in life, the hour of disappointed love is the most
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span>critical. Calm spectators of mortal folly who have
been satisfactorily married for twenty years and more,
who have sons to provide for and daughters to establish,
cherish a disdain of love-stories and boast that
they have no patience with morbidity. Love&mdash;which
put them into being and keeps the earth in existence&mdash;seems
to all such a silly malady peculiar to the
sentimental in early youth. So they put the First
Cause&mdash;in one of its many manifestations&mdash;in the
waste-paper basket, asking each other what will
become of Charles if he cannot find a rich wife, and
poor Alice, if she cannot entrap a suitable husband.
But there are others who look on life with some hope
of understanding it truly, in part, at any rate, and
these know, perhaps by experience, perhaps by
sympathy, that whereas bodily disturbances may pass
away leaving little or no effect upon the general health,
all mental tumults are perpetual in their consequences:
they never die out entirely, and they live, sometimes
with appalling energy, sometimes with gnawing listlessness,
to the end of an existence. Robert, in the
judgment of his intellect and his senses, had found his
ideal. Brigit did not belong to &#8220;the despised day of
small things&#8221;; she was the woman of his imagination&mdash;the
well-beloved, and having gained her, was he to
say&mdash;Farewell? It seemed so. Meanwhile, the
graceful, swaying dialogue rippled between the players
on the stage; the smiling audience, hushed with
interest, gazed at the delightful beings before them;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">[386]</a></span>the exquisite Marquise had uttered her two last
speeches&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p>&#8220;<i>Je ne croyois pas l'amitié si dangereuse.</i>&#8221;</p></div>

<p>and&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p>&#8220;<i>Je ne me mêle plus de rien!</i>&#8221;</p></div>

<p>Lubin brought the performance to an end by the
final utterance&mdash;</p>

<div class="center"><p>&#8220;<i>Allons de la joie!</i>&#8221;</p></div>

<p>The curtain fell&mdash;to rise again a dozen times.
Orange did not hear the door of the box being
opened. Prince d'Alchingen came in and put a hand
on the young man's shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Would you like to see her?&#8221; he whispered. &#8220;I
can arrange it. No one need know.&#8221;</p>

<p>But the training of a lifetime and constant habits
of thought were stronger still than any mood.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Robert, shortly, &#8220;I won't see her. I
must get back to London at once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">[387]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>


<p>The Prince looked at him in astonishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;You can't get to London to-night,&#8221; said he; &#8220;there
are no trains.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I can walk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is thirty-five miles.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am accustomed to long walks.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;At any rate you will have some supper first&mdash;in
my little breakfast-room. Don't refuse, because I
want you to meet Castrillon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Castrillon! I should like to meet Castrillon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then I will tell him. You and he can take
supper together. He doesn't want to join the big
party. He has the artist's detestation of the chattering
mob. How well he plays! And what a
triumph for&mdash;Madame!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A great triumph.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This corridor leads to my tiny cupboard&mdash;the
merest cupboard! Follow me.&#8221; They went through
several doors and up several small staircases till they
reached a small apartment furnished in old blue
damask, heavily fringed with tarnished gold and
silver decorations.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">[388]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;A few souvenirs of my hereditary castle in
Alberia,&#8221; explained the Prince; &#8220;they relieve my
sense of exile.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked across the floor and tapped on what
appeared to be a portion of the wall.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are here,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>The secret door was opened, and Castrillon, still
wearing his costume as the Chevalier, joined them. If
one may believe Prince d'Alchingen's account of this
unfortunate meeting, the young men greeted each
other with composure. D'Alchingen declares that
he studied Orange to the depths of his soul, and he
does him the justice to say that he did not make a
movement or utter a word which denoted the least
emotion. There was not any sort of alteration in his
countenance, and he led the conversation with a
tranquillity and a gaiety really enchanting. When
the supper was served, His Excellency had no hesitation
in leaving the rivals together&mdash;so convinced was
he that they would remain on good terms.</p>

<p>&#8220;M. de Castrillon,&#8221; said Orange, when the Prince
had gone, &#8220;I cannot sit down at supper with you.
We have to settle an old score.&#8221;</p>

<p>Castrillon bowed:</p>

<p>&#8220;I am here to learn your wishes. I have heard
from several sources that you wished to see me. If
you have anything to say, pray say it quickly,
because&mdash;I have an appointment with Mrs. Parflete.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">[389]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you do me the favour to leave that lady's
name out of the discussion?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I see no reason why I should do you favours,
M. de Hausée. But I am quite ready to atone for
my indifference by any course of action which could
satisfy the most scrupulous delicacy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is but one course of action open to us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be happy to have the honour of meeting
you on your own terms. But,&#8221; he added, contemptuously,
&#8220;we are both wasting our time over
a worthless woman. She was seen leaving your
lodgings on Wednesday last. I have just heard this.
And I received, before the play began this evening, a
letter from her fixing a <i>rendez-vous</i> for two o'clock.
If you doubt me I can show you the letter. I am as
much disappointed as you are. She has fooled us
both. Before God I could have sworn she was a
religious and modest woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>His chagrin was so genuine that it was impossible
to doubt his good faith.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a lie,&#8221; said Orange; &#8220;she was never at my
lodgings.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't call <i>you</i> a liar, M. de Hausée, but I can
prove my words, whereas it might be difficult to prove
yours. I can show you the letter.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She never wrote it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Castrillon sat on the edge of the table, and poured
out some wine.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what I said,&#8221; he replied, &#8220;when I read
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_390" id="Page_390">[390]</a></span>it. So long as we are going to fight, let it be because
we hate each other, and not because we have both
been deceived by the same prude.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In other words,&#8221; said Orange, quietly, &#8220;you wish
to drive a good bargain, knowing that whether you
utter one insult or twenty, I can but fight you once.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;<i>A l'outrance</i>, however,&#8221; answered Castrillon, dipping
a biscuit into the glass.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, <i>à l'outrance</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This being the case, let me tell you a few of my
ideas. You find life very hard. I find it altogether
amusing. I don't love a woman the less when I cease
to honour her. I don't honour a man the less when
I detest him. If you should kill me, M. de Hausée,
it will be the most respectable occurrence in my
immortality. But if I should kill you, it will be the
vile conclusion of an exemplary career.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Your conversation is most entertaining, Monsieur.
I am, unhappily, in no mood to listen to it. May I
ask you to meet me to-morrow with your second at
three o'clock at Calais? We can then go on to
Dunkerque and settle this difference.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am perfectly agreeable.&#8221;</p>

<p>They arranged a few more details and parted. The
interview, which took place in French, is not easily
reproduced in English. Orange wrote one account
of the scene, and Castrillon confided another to Prince
d'Alchingen, and the above is probably as nearly as
possible a faithful description of what actually passed.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">[391]</a></span></p>
<p>Robert left Hadley Lodge, and plunged through
the darkness toward London. He reached Vigo
Street about seven o'clock in the morning. It was
Sunday, and the streets were silent. He let himself
into the house with a latch-key, and groped his way
up the creaking unlit staircase. On entering his
room, the draught between the open window and
the door set all his papers whirling from his writing-table,
and, by a strange accident, dislodged his crucifix
from its nail. It fell to the ground, and when he
picked it up, the small Figure was broken. This
accident seemed an ill omen, but he put it from his
thoughts, and scrawled a hasty letter to Charles
Aumerle, asking him to be his second. This he
delivered himself at Aumerle's chambers in St.
James's Place, saying that he would call for an
answer at nine. But Aumerle, ever fond of adventures,
was at Vigo Street at half-past eight.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are bent upon it,&#8221; said he, &#8220;I will do
everything in my power to see it through. I think
you are quite right. Every one will say the same.&#8221;</p>

<p>The two left for Calais by the first boat that
morning. Castrillon, and Isidore, and a young
Frenchman, M. de Lamoignon, were on board also.
At Calais the two seconds conferred, and the duel
was arranged to take place in a field near Dunkerque
on the following morning. On the following
morning, the four men met. The combatants were
placed at fifteen paces from each other. They fired
simultaneously and Castrillon fell&mdash;mortally wounded.</p>

<p>Brigit returned on Monday to Pensée at Curzon
Street. It was the anniversary of Lord Fitz Rewes's
death. The two women went to Catesby, where
they visited his grave together, prayed together, and,
in the quiet evening, sat by the library fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is a great contrast for you after all the
excitement on Saturday night,&#8221; said Pensée. &#8220;You
are full of surprises, Brigit. Few young girls, having
made such a brilliant success, would care to spend
their time with poor, dull women like me. They would
naturally wish to enjoy the triumph.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brigit's eyes filled with tears.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know what you mean, <i>cher coeur</i>,&#8221; she answered,
&#8220;but there are no triumphs for any artist. We suffer
and we work&mdash;sometimes we are able to please. But
we suffer and work because we must; whereas we
please by the merest accident.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is true, no doubt. One might as well
speak of a successful saint as a successful artist.
Every saint is not canonized, and every artist is not
praised. But surely appreciation is a help.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">[393]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, dearest; and I am grateful for it. And it
gives encouragement to one's friends!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let us suppose that they had not cared for your
acting, dear child. What then?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should have known that it was my vocation just
the same. Don't believe that I shan't have my full
share of doubts and struggles. This little first step
makes me the more anxious about my next.&#8221;</p>

<p>The older woman looked at her, and sighed deeply.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are too young to know life so well! I am
sure you have suffered more severely than any of us&mdash;who
say more and cry more. Your face has
changed a good deal in the last day or two. In
one way, it isn't so pretty as it was.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No one can look quite so plain as I can look,
Pensée,&#8221; she answered, laughing.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me finish what I had in my mind! You
are not so pretty&mdash;not so much like a picture. But
when I see you now, I don't think about your features
at all. I watch your expressions&mdash;they suggest the
whole world to me&mdash;all the things I have thought and
felt. Rachel's face is like that. I am sure now that
you were meant to be an actress. I have been very
stupid. How I wish I understood you better, and
could be more of a friend. I don't understand Robert
entirely. Do you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I understand him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder how you came to love each other. I
suppose it happened for the best. But it seems such a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">[394]</a></span>pity&#8221;&mdash;she paused and then repeated the words&mdash;&#8220;it
seems such a pity that all doesn't come right&mdash;in the
old-fashioned way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It has come right, dear,&#8221; said Brigit; &#8220;perfectly
right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You try to think so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it. His father sinned, and my father
sinned. We were born for unhappiness. Unhappiness
and misgivings are in our very blood.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But how unjust!&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, dearest, on the contrary, it is strict justice.
The laws of the universe are immutable. You might
as well ask that fire should only burn sometimes&mdash;that
it may be water, or air, or earth to suit sentimental
occasions.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't like to see you so sensible&mdash;it's&mdash;it's
<i>unlikely</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brigit smiled at the word&mdash;a favourite one with
Pensée when persons and events differed from the
serene, unreasoned fiction which she called her experience.</p>

<p>&#8220;How can you call anything unlikely?&#8221; asked the
girl. &#8220;I ought never to have been born at all, and
Life has made no provision for me. She is boisterous
and homely&mdash;like a housekeeper at an inn. She
doesn't know me, and she has prepared no room for
me. But I may rest on the staircase&mdash;that's under
shelter at least.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What whimsical ideas, darling!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">[395]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, to feel as I feel, you must have had my
parents. You mustn't suppose that I woke up one
morning and saw the reason for all my troubles. The
reason did not come as though it were the sun shining
into the room. Oh, no! I found no answer for a
long, long time. But I feel it now. My father
could not take me into his world, and my mother's
world&mdash;<i>I</i> could not take. They wished to know
that I was protected, so they found some one who
knew the story, and knew both worlds. I was grateful,
because I didn't understand. And when I understood
I was still grateful, but I couldn't accept the
terms. My marriage was not so terrible as many
marriages. Yet it was terrible enough. Don't let
us talk of it, Pensée. It is hopeless to quarrel with
logic. Science is calm&mdash;as calm as the hills.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And Robert?&#8221; said the older woman. &#8220;What
about Robert?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;His father was a Dominican. The Church will
have her own again. Be quite sure of that!</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<i>
<span class="i0">&#8216;Thy justice is like the great mountains.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy judgments are a great deep.&#8217;<br /></span>
</i>
</div></div>

<p>In God's way, all will come right. Every debt
must be paid.&#8221;</p>

<p>Although they had arranged to journey back to
London the following day, the woods and gardens
looked so fair, the peace of that house was so great,
that they lingered there till Wednesday. Brigit was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">[396]</a></span>unusually silent. She sat for hours at the library
window looking across the Channel toward France,
her countenance drawn and white, all its loveliness
departed.</p>

<p>Once she spoke&mdash;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know that Robert is in sorrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you anxious? Shall I write?&#8221; asked Pensée,
secretly troubled also.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I am not anxious. There is sorrow, but I
am not anxious.&#8221;</p>

<p>Her room adjoined Pensée's, and, in the night,
Pensée, sleepless, heard her walking to and fro, with
even steps, till sunrise. When they met in the
morning, Brigit seemed to have aged by ten years.
Her youth returned, but the character of her face had
altered for ever. She was never called pretty again.
It was said that she varied and depended wholly on
her moods. She could make herself anything, but
nature had given her little more than a pair of eyes,
a nose, and a mouth&mdash;indifferent good. Lady Fitz
Rewes was appalled at the transformation. Remembering
stories of the last dreadful touches of consumption,
she feared for the girl's health. &#8220;She will die
before long,&#8221; she thought. But death can occur
more than once in one life. The passing away of
every strong emotion means a burial and a grave, a
change, and a resurrection. The tearful, dusty, fiery,
airy process must be endured seventy times seven and
more, and more again&mdash;from everlasting to everlasting.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">[397]</a></span>And the cause is nothing, the motives are nothing, the
great, great affliction and the child's little woe pass
alike through the Process&mdash;for the Process belongs to
the eternal law, whereas the rest is of the heart's
capacity.</p>

<p>The way to the city&mdash;through the beautiful south
of England, beautiful at all seasons of the year and
sad also at all seasons&mdash;brought something which
resembled calm to both their minds. Dwellings
closely packed together destroy, or disturb, the finer
vision of the grandeur, sternness, and depth of life.
At Catesby, the solitude and the waves exercised
their power over the spirit, diverting it from trivial
speculations to awe and wonder. There, where the
unseen could move freely and the invisible manifest
itself on the perpetual rocks, the towering trees, the
still green fields, and the vast acres of the sea, one
could hear the dreaming prophet proclaim the burden
of the Lord; and the voice of mirth and the voice of
gladness, the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of
the bride, the sound of the mill-stones and the light
of the candle mattered not. But the kingdom of all
the worlds&mdash;the worlds and habitations not made with
hands&mdash;rose up as the real theatre of man's destiny
and the fit measure of his achievements. It is that
sense of the eternity of consequences&mdash;and that sense
only&mdash;which can satisfy the human heart. Time is
too short, this planet is too small, and this mortal
body is too weak for the surging thoughts, the unin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">[398]</a></span>telligible
desires of the soul. Nothing less than infinity
can hallow emotions: their passingness&mdash;which seems
the rule in the fever and turmoil of city life&mdash;is not
their abatement but their degradation. Change they
must, but perish utterly they may not.</p>

<p>The women travellers, as the lights of the capital
grew more numerous, and the roar of the traffic louder
and more constant, drew back within themselves,
assuming, unconsciously, the outward bearing&mdash;fatigued,
sceptical, and self-distrustful&mdash;of the town-bred.
When they reached Curzon Street, the two
heaps of letters, the telegrams and cards on the hall-table
symbolised crudely enough the practical side of
daily affairs. One name&mdash;an unknown one&mdash;among
the many engraved on the white scraps caught Brigit's
attention at once:</p>

<div class="center">
<p><i>The Rev. J. M. Foster.</i></p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;That gentleman is a priest, Madam,&#8221; said the
butler; &#8220;he will call again this evening. I told
him that we expected you and her Ladyship about
seven.&#8221;</p>

<p>For some reason she felt alarmed. All that day and
the night before she had been agitated by an inexplicable
dread of strange tidings. She went to her
room, but, without removing her travelling cloak or
her hat, she sat down on the edge of her bed, waiting
for some summons. Presently it came. Father
Foster was in the library with Lady Fitz Rewes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">[399]</a></span>Would Mrs. Parflete see him? She went down,
and Pensée stood watching for her at the open
door.</p>

<p>&#8220;My poor child!&#8221; she said, with a sob in her voice,
as she drew Brigit into the room. &#8220;My poor child,&#8221;
she repeated, &#8220;Father Foster has come to tell us that&mdash;that
Mr. Parflete died last night.&#8221;</p>

<p>The priest stepped forward with the decision, and
also the stern kindness, of those accustomed to break
hard messages.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was injured in a quarrel, and died from the
effect of the wound. He declined to give any particulars
of the affair, and I fear we must call it a mystery.
He asked me to say that his last words to you
were these: <i>Amate da cui male aveste</i>&mdash;Love those
from whom ye have had evil.&#8221;</p>

<p>He looked at her compassionately as he spoke,
wondering, no doubt, how great the evil had been.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can I go to him?&#8221; asked Brigit; &#8220;where is
he?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where he died&mdash;in his room at the hotel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will go with you,&#8221; said Pensée. She held
Brigit's hand, and exchanged a long glance with
Father Foster.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did you say,&#8221; she asked, &#8220;that he left any letters
or papers?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He destroyed all his papers, but he has left one
letter addressed to you. He wished me to say, in the
presence of Mrs. Parflete, that this had reference to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_400" id="Page_400">[400]</a></span>some false report about her visiting Mr. Orange's
lodgings. Mr. Parflete saw the lady who went to
Vigo Street, and he did not know who she was. One
thing, however, he did know: he had never seen
her before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brigit inclined her head, but remained motionless,
where she first halted when she entered the
room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Did he die in pain?&#8221; she asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid he suffered greatly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Was his mind at peace?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe so&mdash;from my heart.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He had less to fear from God than man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The justice of God is severe,&#8221; said the priest,
&#8220;but He can never make mistakes. The hardest
cruelties in this life are the mistakes which we
commit in judging others&mdash;perhaps in judging ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The carriage is at the door,&#8221; whispered Pensée,
touching Brigit's arm. &#8220;Shall we go?&#8221;</p>

<p>Nothing was said during the drive to the hotel
near Covent Garden. Brigit sat with closed eyes
and folded hands while Lady Fitz Rewes, lost in
thought, stared out of the window. At last the
horses stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is the place,&#8221; said Father Foster.</p>

<p>A large gas-lamp hung over the entrance, and two
Swiss waiters, with forced solemnity, ushered the
party through the hall and up the staircase. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">[401]</a></span>tapped at a door, listened, from force of habit, for an
answer which never came, and then turned the
handle. Parflete's bed had been moved to the
centre of the room. There was a table covered
with a white cloth, on which four candles burnt.
By the window there was a chair littered with illustrated
newspapers.</p>

<p>&#8220;The nurse has just gone down to his supper,&#8221;
explained one of the waiters, &#8220;but <i>le mort est bien
convenable</i>.&#8221;</p>

<p>The dead man had been dressed in a rose-silk shirt
embroidered with forget-me-nots. Upon his crossed
arms lay a small ivory crucifix. In place of his wig
he wore a black velvet skull-cap. The face was
yellow: the features seemed set in a defiant, ironical
smile. Hardship, terror, remorse, and physical agony
had left their terrible scars upon his countenance.</p>

<p>Brigit, overcome at the sight of these awful
changes, fell weeping on Pensée's shoulder.</p>

<p>&#8220;Thank God!&#8221; she whispered, &#8220;he has no more
to fear from men.&#8221;</p>

<p>When she grew calmer, she knelt down by the
body, and told them that she would watch there
that night.</p>

<p>&#8220;Madness!&#8221; exclaimed Lady Fitz Rewes.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, no! I wish to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The priest stated a few objections, but she remained
firm in her resolve.</p>

<p>&#8220;He was my father's friend,&#8221; she said, quietly.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">[402]</a></span></p>
<p>They both noticed that she never once referred to
Parflete as her husband.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you stay, Brigit, I too will stay,&#8221; said Pensée.</p>

<p>&#8220;That, dearest, you must decide for yourself. In
any case, I cannot leave him. Tell the nurse not to
come back. And let me be alone here for a little
while.&#8221;</p>

<p>Lady Fitz Rewes and Father Foster went downstairs
to the coffee-room, and made a pretence of eating
dinner. The two talked about the deplorable marriage,
the Orange affair, Brigit's talents. Of course,
she was very young. But Rachel&mdash;the great Rachel&mdash;made
her first triumph at seventeen.</p>

<p>&#8220;One doesn't like to say it,&#8221; observed Pensée, &#8220;but
this death seems providential. If she marries Orange,
she will give up the stage. Poor child! At last it
really looks as though she might be happy&mdash;like other
people.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Like other people,&#8221; repeated the priest, mechanically.</p>

<p>&#8220;I must send word to my housekeeper that I intend
to remain here all night. And I should like our
letters&mdash;I had no time to look at them.&#8221;</p>

<p>A messenger was despatched, and they resumed
their former conversation.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid,&#8221; said Pensée, &#8220;that poor Mr. Parflete
was dreadfully wicked.&#8221;</p>

<p>The priest sighed, and made some remarks about
the dead man's intellectual brilliancy:</p>

<p>&#8220;He had great learning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">[403]</a></span>&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me, Father, with all your experience, do you
understand life?&#8221; asked Pensée, abruptly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me take refuge in a quotation&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<i>
<span class="i8">&#8216;Justice divine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mends not her slowest pace for pray'rs or cries.&#8217;<br /></span>
</i>
</div></div>

<p>I can understand that at least,&#8221; answered the
priest.</p>

<p>&#8220;How odd that you should speak of justice. Brigit
was talking in the same strain only yesterday. It's a
gloomy strain&mdash;for a young girl.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't think so. One shouldn't sentimentalise.
Life goes on, it doesn't halt: it's a constant development.
I haven't much patience with&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>He stopped short.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray finish the sentence.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, I haven't much patience with those who
want to linger, and look back, and cheat time. One
must get along.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pensée felt annoyed, and began to talk coldly about
the housing of the poor, and winters which she had
spent in Florence.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here are your letters,&#8221; exclaimed her companion
suddenly.</p>

<p>She turned them over with languid interest, murmuring
unconsciously to herself the names of her
correspondents.</p>

<p>&#8220;From dear Ethel. Why is she in Edinburgh? I
hope her father isn't ill again. Alice. Uncle. Mrs.
Lanark. Mary Butler. Prince d'Alchingen. That
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">[404]</a></span>tiresome Miss Bates. Mr. Seward.&#8221; She paused and
flushed deeply. &#8220;Robert.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then she turned to Father Foster with shining eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;This letter,&#8221; said she, &#8220;is from Mr. Orange.
Don't you admire his handwriting?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A beautiful hand, certainly.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wonder what he has to say, and why he is
abroad. Isn't that a foreign stamp?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The post-mark is Paris.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So it is. Will you excuse me if I read it.&#8221;</p>

<p>She broke the seal, and read the contents, while
every vestige of colour left her face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I can't make it out,&#8221; she said; &#8220;there must be
another letter for Brigit. Will you look?&#8221;</p>

<p>He untied the packet, and recognised presently
Orange's handwriting on an envelope.</p>

<p>&#8220;You seem rather displeased,&#8221; said Pensée; &#8220;you
think this is all very strange. It&mdash;it isn't a common
case.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No case is common.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, you must help me to decide whether I
ought to give her this letter at once. I can't take
so much responsibility.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither can I. She is a perfectly free woman
now, at any rate.&#8221;</p>

<p>He did not approve of the situation, and he made
no attempt to conceal his feelings. His face became
set. Pensée thought she detected a certain reprimand
in the very tone of his voice.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_405" id="Page_405">[405]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;It isn't a common case,&#8221; she repeated again.
&#8220;He says he is on his way to Rome&mdash;to the Jesuits&mdash;for
a long Retreat, if they will take him. If he
knew&mdash;what has happened&mdash;he might change his
mind.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What! you would have him turn back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, don't be so hard.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am not hard,&#8221; he added more gently. &#8220;But
would this woman, if she really loved him, wish him
to turn back? And, if there is anything in him,
could he ever be happy in any stopping short of
the fullest renunciation&mdash;once resolved on that
renunciation?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ah, don't put it that way to her. She has had
so much trouble already. Your Church seems so
selfish. Forgive me, but I do resent these celibate
views. They are unnatural.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shan't interfere. Take her the letter by all
means. She must decide for herself.&#8221;</p>

<p>Pensée rose from the table, and went up the stairs
to the room where Brigit still knelt by Parflete's dead
body.</p>

<p>&#8220;Dearest,&#8221; said Lady Fitz Rewes, &#8220;I think you
ought to read this letter. I have had one also.
Robert thinks of taking a great step, and perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&#8220;</p>

<p>Her glance met Brigit's.</p>

<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; said Brigit, under her breath: &#8220;no.&#8221;</p>

<p>Then, with trembling hands, she read the letter
once, twice, three times.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">[406]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;Say something,&#8221; said Pensée, touching her. &#8220;Say
something, Brigit.&#8221;</p>

<p>She smiled and held the letter to the candle flame.
It caught fire and burnt away quickly while she
held it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mind your hand&mdash;it will catch your hand.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don't feel it,&#8221; said Brigit. She bore the scar of
that burn always.</p>

<p>&#8220;Say something,&#8221; implored Pensée.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is on his way to Rome. He asks me not to
write to him. Castrillon is dying. They fought a
duel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But of course you will write&mdash;now. You must
write.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hasn't my love done harm enough already? I
will never see him again. I shall never write to him
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can't mean that. You can't realise what
you are saying. People will like him all the better
for fighting Castrillon.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, it isn't the duel, Pensée. He sees his way
clearly. He has always tried not to see it. I, too,
have tried not to see it. But all that is at an end
now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And he will renounce his career.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Everything! Everything!&#8221;</p>

<p>Pensée threw up her hands, and left the room.
Father Foster was standing under a gas-jet at the end
of the corridor reading his office. He looked at Lady
Fitz Rewes.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">[407]</a></span></p>
<p>&#8220;She won't stand in his way?&#8221; he asked quietly.</p>

<p>&#8220;She won't stand in his way,&#8221; she answered. &#8220;I
hope you realise what that means&mdash;to her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope I can realise what it means to both of
them,&#8221; said he.</p>

<p>In 1879, a distinguished author who was engaged in
writing a history of the Catholic Movement in
England, begged Mr. Disraeli, then Earl of Beaconsfield,
for some particulars, not generally known, of
Robert Orange's life.</p>

<p>He replied as follows:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote><p class="i16"><span class="smcap">Hughenden Manor</span>, <i>Nov. 28, 1879</i>.</p><p class="nospaceabove"><span class="smcap">My dear F.</span>,&mdash;You ask me for an estimate of
Monsignor Orange. Questions are always easy. Let
me offer you facts in return. The Castrillon duel was
a nine days' wonder&mdash;much discussed and soon forgotten.
Castrillon left a letter with his second, M. de Lamoignon,
to the effect that he had offered Orange &#8220;intolerable
insults&#8221; which &#8220;no man of honour&#8221; could have suffered.
Mrs. Parflete's name did not transpire, but Prince
d'Alchingen and others gave speculation no industry on
the matter. We were at no loss to know the real cause
of the quarrel. Orange applied for the Chiltern Hundreds
and went into strict retreat for six months. During that
time he saw no friends, wrote no letters, read none. I
remember his conduct was severely criticised, because the
death of Parflete opened out other possibilities of action.
He was not a man, however, whom one could order to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">[409]</a></span>this, that, or the other; still less could one reproach him
for not being this, that, or the other. It was his faith to
believe that salvation rests on the negation and renunciation
of personality. He pushed this to the complete
suppression of his Will, tenderly considered. I need not
detain you on the familiar dogmas of Christianity with
regard to the reign of nature and the reign of grace.
Your view may be expressed thus:&mdash;</p><div class="center"><p>&#8220;<i>Puis-qu'il aime à périr, je consens qu'il périsse</i>,</p></div><p>and you will think that Orange said of Mrs. Parflete, as
Polyeucte of his wife:&mdash;</p>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><i>&#8220;Je ne regarde Pauline</i><br/></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Que comme un obstacle à mon bien.&#8221;</i><br/></span>
</div></div>
<p>This would be an injustice. Orange was, to me, a
deeply interesting character. I saw little of him after he
entered the priesthood, but his writings, his sermons, and
the actual work he accomplished proved conclusively
enough that he was right in following&mdash;and we were
wrong in opposing&mdash;his true vocation. The Church
received her own again. Rome did not smile at him at
first. A de Hausée, however, never yet tapped long at
any gate. The family&mdash;which had been stirred to fury
by his father's trespass&mdash;welcomed the son as a prodigal
manqué. His aunt, the Princess Varese, left him half
of her large fortune. He lived himself in great seclusion
and simplicity, and died, as you are aware, of over-work
last year. The one friend he corresponded with and
occasionally saw was Lady Fitz Rewes. Sara de Treverell
did not marry the Duke of Marshire, but three years
before Orange's death she took the veil, and is now a
Carmelite nun. Many people were amazed at this, but I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">[410]</a></span>was not. Mrs. Parflete, Orange never saw again after the
night of her performance at Prince d'Alchingen's. Her
career continues. From time to time a rumour reaches me
that she is about to marry a nobleman, an author, her
manager, or an American millionaire. Quite a mistake.
She, too, is a visionary, and, I should say, respectable.
If you have not seen her act, seize the first opportunity.
If you think of writing more than the merest sketch of
Orange's strange career, may I suggest the following motto
from the <i>Purgatorio</i>?&mdash;</p><div class="center"><p>&#8220;<i>Cast down the seed of weeping and attend.</i>&#8221;</p></div><p class="i8">Yours very sincerely, my dear F.,</p><p class="i12 nospaceabove"><span class="smcap">Beaconsfield</span>.</p></blockquote>

<h3> WORKS BY JOSEPH CONRAD</h3>
<h3>I.</h3>
<h2 class="nospaceabove">AN OUTCAST OF THE ISLANDS</h2>
<h3 class="subhead nospaceabove"><i>Crown 8vo., cloth</i>, <b>6s.</b></h3>

<p>&#8220;Subject to the qualifications thus disposed of (<i>vide</i> first part of notice),
&#8216;An Outcast of the Islands&#8217; is perhaps the finest piece of fiction that has been
published this year, as &#8216;Almayer's Folly&#8217; was one of the finest that was published
in 1895.... Surely this is real romance&mdash;the romance that is real.
Space forbids anything but the merest recapitulation of the other living
realities of Mr. Conrad's invention&mdash;of Lingard, of the inimitable Almayer,
the one-eyed Babalatchi, the Naturalist, of the pious Abdulla&mdash;all novel, all
authentic. Enough has been written to show Mr. Conrad's quality. He
imagines his scenes and their sequence like a master; he knows his individualities
and their hearts; he has a new and wonderful field in this East Indian
Novel of his.... Greatness is deliberately written; the present writer has
read and re-read his two books, and after putting this review aside for some
days to consider the discretion of it, the word still stands.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Saturday Review</i></p>

<p><b>&#8220;This startling, unique, splendid book.&#8221;</b>&mdash;Mr. T. P. <span class="smcap">O'Connor</span>, M.P.</p>
</div>

<p>&#8220;This is a decidedly powerful story of an uncommon type, and breaks fresh
ground in fiction.... All the leading characters in the book&mdash;Almayer, his
wife, his daughter, and Dain, the daughter's native lover&mdash;are well drawn, and
the parting between father and daughter has a pathetic naturalness about it,
unspoiled by straining after effect. There are, too, some admirably graphic
passages in the book. The approach of a monsoon is most effectively
described.... The name of Mr. Joseph Conrad is new to us, but it appears
to us as if he might become the Kipling of the Malay Archipelago.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Spectator</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Louis Becke wields a powerful pen, with the additional advantage
that he waves it in unfrequented places, and summons up with it the elemental
passions of human nature.... It will be seen that Mr. Becke is somewhat
of the fleshly school, but with a pathos and power not given to the ordinary
professors of that school.... Altogether for those who like stirring stories
cast in strange scenes, this is a book to be read.&#8221;&mdash;<i>National Observer.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The appearance of a new book by Mr. Becke has become an event of note&mdash;and
very justly. No living author, if we except Mr. Kipling, has so amazing
a command of that unhackneyed vitality of phrase that most people call by
the name of realism. Whether it is scenery or character or incident that he
wishes to depict, the touch is ever so dramatic and vivid that the reader is
conscious of a picture and impression that has no parallel save in the records
of actual sight and memory.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Westminster Gazette.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Another series of sketches of island life in the South Seas, not inferior to
those contained in &#8216;By Reef and Palm.&#8217;&#8221;&mdash;<i>Speaker.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The book is well worth reading. The author knows what he is talking
about and has a keen eye for the picturesque.&#8221;&mdash;<i>G. B. Burgin in To-day.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Here is one of the books which are at present coming singly and at long
intervals, like early swallows, to herald, it is to be hoped, a larger flight.
When the larger flight appears, the winter of our discontent will have passed,
and we shall be able to boast that the short story can make a home east as
well as west of the Atlantic. There is plenty of human nature&mdash;of the Scottish
variety, which is a very good variety&mdash;in &#8216;The Stickit Minister&#8217; and its companion
stories; plenty of humour, too, of that dry, pawky kind which is a
monopoly of &#8216;Caledonia, stern and wild&#8217;; and, most plentiful of all, a quiet
perception and reticent rendering of that underlying pathos of life which is to
be discovered, not in Scotland alone, but everywhere that a man is found who
can see with the heart and the imagination as well as the brain. Mr. Crockett
has given us a book that is not merely good, it is what his countrymen would
call &#8216;by-ordinar' good,&#8217; which, being interpreted into a tongue understanded of
the southern herd, means that it is excellent, with a somewhat exceptional kind
of excellence.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Daily Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Crockett's &#8216;Lilac Sun-Bonnet&#8217; &#8216;needs no bush.&#8217; Here is a pretty love
tale, and the landscape and rural descriptions carry the exile back into the
Kingdom of Galloway. Here, indeed, is the scent of bog-myrtle and peat.
After inquiries among the fair, I learn that of all romances, they best love
not &#8216;sociology,&#8217; not &#8216;theology,&#8217; still less, open manslaughter, for a motive, but
just love's young dream, chapter after chapter. From Mr. Crockett they get
what they want, &#8216;hot with,&#8217; as Thackeray admits that he liked it.&#8221;&mdash;Mr.

<h3>Some Reviews on the First Edition.</h3>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Nancy Noon&#8217; is perhaps the strongest book of the year, certainly by far
the strongest book which has been published by any new writer.... Mr.
Swift contrives to keep his book from end to end real, passionate, even intense....
If Mr. Meredith had never written, one would have predicted, with the
utmost confidence, a great future for Mr. Benjamin Swift, and even as it is I
have hopes.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Sketch.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly a promising first effort&#8221;&mdash;<i>Whitehall Review.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;If &#8216;Nancy Noon&#8217; be Mr. Swift's first book, it is a success of an uncommon
kind.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Dundee Advertiser.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Nancy Noon&#8217; is one of the most remarkable novels of the year, and the
author, avowedly a beginner, has succeeded in gaining a high position in the
ranks of contemporary writers.... All his characters are delightful. In the
heat of sensational incidents or droll scenes we stumble on observations that
set us reflecting, and but for an occasional roughness of style&mdash;elliptical,
Carlyle mannerisms&mdash;the whole is admirably written.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Westminster Gazette.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Swift has the creative touch and a spark of genius.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Manchester
Guardian.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Swift has held us interested from the first to the last page of his
novel.&#8221;&mdash;<i>World.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;The writer of &#8216;Nancy Noon&#8217; has succeeded in presenting a powerfully
written and thoroughly interesting story.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Scotsman.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;We are bound to admit that the story interested us all through, that it
absorbed us towards the end, and that not until the last page had been read
did we find it possible to lay the book down.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Daily Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;It is a very strong book, very vividly coloured, very fascinating in its style,
very compelling in its claim on the attention, and not at all likely to be soon
forgotten.&#8221;&mdash;<i>British Weekly.</i></p>

<p>&#8220;A clever book ... The situations and ensuing complications are dramatic,
and are handled with originality and daring throughout.&#8221;&mdash;<i>Daily News.</i></p>

<blockquote><p>Medical discoveries more directly concern the well-being and happiness of the human
race than any victories of science. They appeal to one of the primary instincts of human
nature, that of self-preservation. The importance of health as the most valuable of
our national assets is coming to be more and more recognised, and the place of the doctor
in Society and in the State is becoming one of steadily increasing prominence; indeed,
Mr. Gladstone said not many years ago that the time would surely come when the medical
profession would take precedence of all the others in authority as well as in dignity. The
development of medicine from an empiric art to an exact science is one of the most
important and also one of the most interesting chapters in the history of civilisation. The
histories of medicine which exist are for the most part only fitted for the intellectual
digestion of Dryasdust and his congeners. Of the men who made the discoveries which
have saved incalculable numbers of human lives, and which have lengthened the span of
human existence, there is often no record at all accessible to the general reader. Yet the
story of these men's lives, of their struggles and of their triumphs, is not only interesting,
but in the highest degree stimulating and educative. Many of them could have said with
literal truth what Sir Thomas Browne said figuratively, that their lives were a romance.
Hitherto there have been no accounts of the lives of medical discoverers in a form at once
convenient and uniform, and sold at a popular price. The &#8220;Masters of Medicine&#8221; is a
series of biographies written by &#8220;eminent hands&#8221; intended to supply this want. It is
intended that the man shall be depicted as he moved and lived and had his being, and that
the scope and gist of his work, as well as the steps by which he reached his results, shall
be set forth in a clear, readable style.</p></blockquote>

<h3>Transcriber's notes:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Inconsistency in hyphenation is as in the original.</li>
<li>Three short footnotes have been moved into the main text, rendered in [] and in italics.</li>
<li>The layout of the advertising material has been standardised somewhat, and dashes inserted consistently
between reviews and their source. (In most but not all cases, a dash was present if the
source was on the same line, but not if on a different line. This distinction is impossible
to preserve in an e-text.)</li>
<li>Two misprinted accents on the French have been moved onto the correct letter.</li>
<li>Page 161: the first word on the page has been changed from "or" to "for" (there is a gap, and this best
fits the context).</li>
<li>Page 195: the name "Bevensey" has been changed to "Pevensey" to match other occurrences
in the book.</li>
<li>Page 201, first full paragraph: The comma after "masters" is possibly incorrect (a period or semi-colon would
be more grammatically correct) but the original has been retained.</li>
<li>Page 354: in the paragraph beginning "In that event", a colon after said has been changed to a
semi-colon, in accordance with normal practice and all other occurrences in the book.</li>
<li>Page 376: a reference to "De Hausée" has been changed to "de Hausée" to match every other occurrence.</li>
</ul>
